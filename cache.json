What started as a small tool I built for a job interview, became \"The Most Over-engineered Deal With It Emoji Generator\":\n- All operations done fully client-side - no backend, no private data leaves your browser.\n- Uses machine learning models (MediaPipe Face Detector task) to automatically scale and position glasses on the detected faces.\n- Extensive customization options for glasses:\n  - Placement of glasses anywhere on the input image (including slightly going outside it).\n  - Change the size of glasses.\n  - No limit on the number of glasses.\n  - Flip the glasses vertically or horizontally.\n  - Customize the direction from which the glasses appear on the image.\n  - Different types of glasses.\n- GIF output options:\n  - Looping mode.\n  - Number of frames.\n  - Frame delay.\n  - Separate delay setting for last frame.\n  - Output size.\n- Celebration confetti \n- Easter eggs.\nI've been working remotely for the last >9 years. When using non-verbal communication, it's important that your tone and intent comes across accurately.. Custom emojis became for me part of expressing yourself, creating bonds and camaraderie. I've originally created an MVP of this tool while applying for a exciting new job opportunity. As a showcase of my passion for programming, building teams and creating delightful user experiences. Unfortunately, they were not impressed and ultimately did not offer me the job :( But I wanted to polish it and release it for everyone to use for free, so that you can too \"Deal With It\"!\nI have more ideas for even more features (check GitHub[1]), but wanted to launch it and see what's the feedback and ideas from the community!\nAnd if you're looking for a Fullstack Developer with >14 years of experience, with passion for great customer experience (remote work or locally in Iceland), let's chat!\n[1] - https://github.com/klimeryk/dealwithit\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41848150\nPoints: 507\n# Comments: 104",

It's about how to organize programs around data \"as plain data\" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.\nJava has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.\nDoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, \"representation is the essence of programming.\" When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.\nThat's my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I'd love to hear your feedback.\nYou can get 50% off (thru October 9th) with code `mlkiehl`\nhttps://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629377\nPoints: 513\n# Comments: 135",

GenAI is also useful for\n       identifying areas of dead code, and has promise for better translations\n       of a system between platforms and languages.\nmore…",
