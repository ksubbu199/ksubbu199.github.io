Fill the form: username, city+country\n2. Copy the text generated in the box below the form, and paste it in your HN description.\n3. Click \"Add me on the map\"\nOptionnaly (it's recommended!) you can add links to your socials as well as some tags to showcase your interests.\nWhy does it exist?\nI created this because, despite its harsh reputation on the internet, I love the HN community.\nI have fewer than a handful of friends who are as curious and eager to think and reflect as the people on HN.\nAlso, the city I currently live in is more focused on industry than on technology and entrepreneurship, which are core to HN.\nThis led me to want to meet the HN community IRL.\nAfter trying `site:news.ycombinator.com/user toulouse` on Google and getting only one result, I decided to create meet.hn.\nMy first goal with this is to meet at least one HN member in my city: Toulouse, France.\nIf you are ever in the area, hit me up! I'm sirobg at https://meet.hn/city/fr-Toulouse\nAdditional details:\n- meet.hn has a twitter page: https://x.com/meet_hn. If you meet IRL thanks to meet.hn, don't hesitate to tag it with a picture, it would mean the world to me.\n- the code is open source: https://github.com/borisghidaglia/meet-hn\n- meet.hn integrates with https://at.hn/ from @padolsey (https://padolsey.at.hn/), registered on meet.hn at https://meet.hn/city/cn-Beijing\nFinally, many thanks to these people for their help and/or feedbacks!\nOrdered alphabetically:\n- https://x.com/ericbureltech\n- https://x.com/fredkisss\n- https://x.com/JulienDuquesne1\n- https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbasseto/\n- https://x.com/lcswillems\n- https://x.com/leeerob\n- https://x.com/padolsey\n- https://x.com/tomlienard\nI hope you will enjoy this!\nPlease share any feedback in the comments.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41539125\nPoints: 508\n# Comments: 253",

Super repairable, of course. Our goal is to make soldering so easy everyone can do it:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/fixhub\nWe didn’t want to make just another iron, so we spent years sweating the details and crafting something that met our exacting standards.

I can't actually access the system so I'm speaking from hearsay and what's information on public parts of their website. The way I understand it works is that you connect Pave to your HR and Payroll systems, they take the data about who you employ and how much you pay them, combine it with all their other companies, and give companies a collective breakdown of compensation ranges.\nMy question is, isn't this specifically anti-competitive wage fixing? This seems exactly like RealPage but for employee compensation. As far as I know, colluding on wages like this is illegal. Is there something about the company that I'm missing?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41510103\nPoints: 676\n# Comments: 267",

          "description": "Cycle Time is a measure of how long it takes to get a new feature in a\n  software system from idea to running in production. In Agile circles, we try\n  to minimize cycle time. We do this by defining and implementing very small\n  features and minimizing delays in the development process. Although the rough\n  notion of cycle time, and the importance of reducing it, is common, there is a\n  lot of variations on how cycle time is measured.\n\n\nA key characteristic of agile software development is a shift from a\n  Waterfall Process, where work is decomposed based on\n  activity (analysis, coding, testing) to an Iterative Process where work is\n  based on a subset of functionality (simple pricing, bulk discount,\n  valued-customer discount). Doing this generates a feedback loop where we can learn\n  fr…",

          "description": "Two decades ago, I posted that I found that the strangler fig plant was an interesting metaphor for the gradual replacement of a legacy system. I didn’t refer to the metaphor since, but meanwhile it grew a life of its own. Other people increasingly referred to the strangler fig approach to modernization, and traffic to that post steadily increased: currently it gets about 5000 page views a month, one of the more popular pages on this site. So I decided I needed to update that page, and have rewritten it, focusing on the core activities we need to do to make a success of such a venture.\n(This summarizes more detailed writing from Ian Cartwright, Rob Horn, and James Lewis.)",
