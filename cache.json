          "description": "Telegram has quietly updated its policy to allow users to report private chats to its moderators following the arrest of founder Pavel Durov in France over “crimes committed by third parties” on the platform. \nThe messaging app, which serves nearly 1 billion monthly active users, has long maintained a reputation for minimal supervision of user interactions.\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday night, Telegram began implementing changes to its moderation policy. “All Telegram apps have ‘Report’ buttons that let you flag illegal content for our moderators — in just a few taps,” the company states on its updated frequently-asked-questions page. \nThe platform has also provided an email address for automated takedown requests, instructing users to include links to content requiring moderator attention.\nIt’s unclear how, and whether, this change impacts Telegram’s ability to respond to requests from law enforcement agencies. The company has previously cooperated with court orders to share some information about its users. \nTechCrunch has reached out to Telegram for comment. \nThe Dubai-headquartered company has additionally edited its FAQ page, removing two sentences that previously emphasized its privacy stance on private chats. The earlier version had stated: “All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them.”\n\n\n\n\nThese policy changes follow Durov’s arrest by French authorities in connection with an investigation into crimes related to child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking, and fraudulent transactions. \n\n\n\n\nResponding to his arrest, Durov posted on his Telegram channel, criticizing the action: “Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach.” \nHe argued that the established practice for countries dissatisfied with an internet service is to initiate legal action against the service itself, rather than its management.",

OSOM Products, which rose out of the smoldering ashes of Essential in 2020, is closing shop. Android Authority was first to report the news, after gaining access to an internal announcement from CEO Jason Keats.\nOSOM always had a difficult road, with plans to launch a privacy-focused handset. And much like Essential before it, the company dealt with its own legal struggles — namely a lawsuit against filed by a former employee alleging financial mismanagement.\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, the company did manage to release a mobile device, though not the first-party phone it had announced. Rather the company lent its technology to a Web3 focused devices from Solana.\nOSOM did manage to bring a product to market under its own name. The OSOM Privacy Cable is effectively a USB cord whose data transfer can be disabled in situations where “juice jackers” might be present.\n“The report in Android Authority is correct, OSOM is sadly shutting down. In May of 2024, having no customers for a mobile phone despite concerted efforts, OSOM at the time decided to pivot to a new project,” CEO Jason Keats said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “OSOM was forced to let go of a number of employees at that time to reduce our burn rate.”\nThe “new project” would appear to refer to an “AI-powered camera” it planned as a followup to its unreleased smartphone. According to initial reports, Keating had attempted to sell the company off to HP, but was unable to strike a deal. \n“Unfortunately, given the bleak market climate for fundraising for consumer electronics startups, we were unable to raise a new round,” Keats says. “While some maintenance operations to ensure contractual requirements will proceed, OSOM’s general operations will shut down on September 6.”",

The metal is an excellent conductor of electricity, used in everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines. But by the end of the decade, the International Energy Agency expects copper supplies to fall 20% short of demand.\nOne stealthily operating startup thinks it can narrow the gap by helping miners extract more copper from their mines. To do that, Colorado-based Endolith is turning to microbes.\n\n\n\n\nToday, most copper is recovered using hydrometallurgy, which generally involves pouring acid on piles of rock, which strips out some portion of the copper.

          "description": "Hiring platform ZipRecruiter is launching a new tool, called ZipIntro, to let employers schedule introductory calls with potential candidates at a set time. The tool will also help recruiters suggest potential candidates using AI.\nEmployers can input information about the role and select a date and time for introductory calls. After that, ZipIntro matches them with potential candidates using AI and sends them an invitation for the call. The tool takes into account employment, education, skills, certifications, interests, and types of jobs users are looking for while matching. \nImage Credits: ZipRecruiter\n\nEmployers can review these responses from candidates, further screen candidates, and line up back-to-back calls. ZipRecruiter then allows employers to connect with candidates through one-on-one video calls on the platform.\n\n\n\n\nThe company said these intro sessions are typically 30-minute to 1-hour long, with each intro call lasting about five minutes. It noted that while these are initial screening calls, some organizations also use this tool to hire high-volume roles that may require fewer interview stages.\nImage Credits: ZipRecruiter\n\nZipRecruiter noted that with ZipIntro, employers get their first RSVP from candidates within 20 minutes of posting the job requirement. \n“With ZipIntro, recruiters and hiring managers can forge those critical connections faster to assess the true potential of each candidate,” Megan Allen, SVP of product at ZipRecruiter said in a statement. “For job seekers, we’re excited to provide them with the opportunity to speak with an employer faster, allowing them to showcase their true personality, soft skills, and passion.”\nThe company is not the only platform utilizing AI to make the hiring process easier. Indeed is also using AI to help people write about their job experiences. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has deployed an AI tool to help recruiters write better job descriptions.",

Previously only able to be checked out one at a time, books were later able to be “borrowed” by many people at once.\n\n\n\n\nThe publishers, which already had an uneasy relationship with both the Internet Archive and the digital book-lending community in general, sued soon after in June 2020.

The problem is that many of those investors, including Montauk Ventures and Ash Pournouri, claim they didn’t sign off on anything. Montauk’s founder, Philip Krim, told Forbes he does not support the financing, and Breslow didn’t have his permission to be included in a list of investors that had approved the deal.\nMeanwhile, BlackRock, along with Hedosophia and Untitled Ventures, reportedly applied for a restraining order in an attempt to “halt” Bolt’s Series F round. The trio claimed through an attorney that Bolt was “coercing its investors by forcing them to choose between paying millions of dollars for new stock or losing most of their existing investment.”\nBolt declined TechCrunch’s request for comment.",

The woman, Dimple Patel, turned herself in on Tuesday.\nPatel was also charged with homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, tampering with evidence, careless driving, reckless driving and prohibited text-based communications, according to a report sent by Pennsylvania State Police. Patel was driving on Interstate 95 at around 3:20 am ET when the crash occurred. She was traveling at about 71 miles per hour in her 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E with the BlueCruise hands-free driving feature and Adaptive Cruise Control systems activated at the time of the crash.\n\n\n\n\nThe men, identified as Aktilek Baktybekov and Tolobek Esenbekov, had pulled over to the left side of the highway and exited their vehicles. Patel rear-ended one of the cars and killed both of the men.\nIn a statement, the Pennsylvania State Police urged drivers to always stay alert and limit distractions when driving. \n“No partially automated vehicle technology should ever be left alone to perform the driving tasks that are required to safely navigate the roads of the Commonwealth,” according to the statement sent to TechCrunch. “While the advancements in technology are immense, always strive to maintain proper control of your vehicle. If you are driving hands free, be aware and ready to regain control if the situation warrants your immediate reaction.”\nThe fatal crash in Pennsylvania — along with another one that happened in Texas in February — is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation. It’s one of a number of ongoing efforts to scrutinize the use of partial automation. But it’s one of the first cases where charges have been brought against the driver, who is supposed to supervise the driver assistance system’s performance and take over if it is about to crash.",

As to what exactly they’ll research, SSI isn’t saying quite yet.\nReuters, citing a source familiar, says that the new funding values SSI at $5 billion. \nPrior to SSI, Sutskever headed the now-dismantled Superalignment team at OpenAI, which focused on general AI safety research. Sutskever quietly departed OpenAI months after a highly-publicized fallout between him, several former OpenAI board members and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over what Sutskever has referred to as a “breakdown in communications.”",

Since 2020, the FTC says, fraud at Bitcoin ATMs has ballooned nearly tenfold, and just in the first half of 2024, consumers have lost more than $66 million to these scams.\nScammers use tactics like fake phone calls, messages and security alerts to convince people that they’re in danger, and that they should deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM to protect it. Then, the scammer may share a QR code to scan at the Bitcoin ATM, which deposits the cash into the scammer’s wallet.",

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted a screenshot in the company’s Channel. (See below). \n\n\n\n\nInstagram notes that users will be able to disable the option to have comments posted on their Stories, if they prefer. \n\n\nThe new feature seems to have been inspired by user behavior. Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, has previously expressed how the Stories format is one of the app’s most popular features and is more widely used than posting content to the main feed. Private messaging is also highly favored by many users who prefer engaging in closed groups with their friends.\nThe addition of public comments to Stories is part of Instagram’s ongoing efforts to increase engagement on the platform. Most recently, the company added the ability to add music to profiles. There’s also a new feature called “Reveal” that allows users to hide Stories so that followers can only see them after sending a DM.",

But he’s also published terrific pieces for The New Yorker looking at the dangers and shortcomings of AI.\n\n\n\n\nYou should really read his latest article in its entirety, but briefly: Chiang argues that the potential of large language models remains “largely theoretical” — thus far, generative AI has been most successful at “lowering our expectations, both of the things we read and of ourselves when we write anything for others to read. It is a fundamentally dehumanizing technology because it treats us as less than what we are: creators and apprehenders of meaning.”\nEven as LLMs improve, Chiang argues that their output will never be art — which he acknowledges is “notoriously hard to define,” but he tries anyway: “Art is something that results from making a lot of choices.” Sure, those choices might not result in a particularly good novel or painting or film, but you’re still “engaged in an act of communication between you and your audience.”\n“We are all products of what has come before us, but it’s by living our lives in interaction with others that we bring meaning into the world,” Chiang concludes. “That is something that an auto-complete algorithm can never do, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”",

It’s also signed a non-exclusive license to use Covariant’s robotic foundation models.\nEarlier this year, Chen told TechCrunch that Covariant is building “a large language model, but for robot language.” In other words, it’s creating AI models for robots, with an initial focus on robotic arms performing common warehouse tasks like bin picking.\n\n\n\n\n“With some of the smartest minds, we will advance fundamental research, marrying our rich expertise to unlock new ways for AI and robots to assist our operations employees,” said Joseph Quinlivan, Vice President of Amazon Fulfillment Technologies & Robotics, in a statement. “[Embedding] Covariant’s AI technology into our existing robot fleet will make them more performant and create real world value for our customers.”\nThe deal sounds similar to Amazon’s hiring of the founders of AI startup Adept back in June — another deal that gave Amazon access to new talent and technology without having to fully acquire an existing startup.\nAt the time, The Verge described this approach as a “reverse acquihire,” where tech giants facing antitrust scrutiny can use hiring and licensing deals to disguise their acquisitions, rather than the other way around. \nCovariant, meanwhile, said it will continue operating under the leadership of Ted Stinson and Tianhao Zhang, with Stinson — who’d been the startup’s COO — now stepping into the CEO role. The company added that it remains “dedicated to delivering the Covariant Brain into production environments across a broad set of global industries, including apparel, health and beauty, grocery, and pharmaceuticals.”",
