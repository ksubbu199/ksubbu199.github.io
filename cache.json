Everything is open-source, including the full production setup — there’s no 'open-core' model here. Check out the repo (https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap).

It's about how to organize programs around data \"as plain data\" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.\nJava has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.\nDoP is based around a very simple idea, and one people have been rediscovering since the dawn of computing, \"representation is the essence of programming.\" When we do a really good job of capturing the data in our domain, the rest of the system tends to fall into place in a way which can feel like it’s writing itself.\nThat's my elevator pitch! The book is currently in early access. I hope you check it out. I'd love to hear your feedback.\nYou can get 50% off (thru October 9th) with code `mlkiehl`\nhttps://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629377\nPoints: 513\n# Comments: 135",

Fill the form: username, city+country\n2. Copy the text generated in the box below the form, and paste it in your HN description.\n3. Click \"Add me on the map\"\nOptionnaly (it's recommended!) you can add links to your socials as well as some tags to showcase your interests.\nWhy does it exist?\nI created this because, despite its harsh reputation on the internet, I love the HN community.\nI have fewer than a handful of friends who are as curious and eager to think and reflect as the people on HN.\nAlso, the city I currently live in is more focused on industry than on technology and entrepreneurship, which are core to HN.\nThis led me to want to meet the HN community IRL.\nAfter trying `site:news.ycombinator.com/user toulouse` on Google and getting only one result, I decided to create meet.hn.\nMy first goal with this is to meet at least one HN member in my city: Toulouse, France.\nIf you are ever in the area, hit me up! I'm sirobg at https://meet.hn/city/fr-Toulouse\nAdditional details:\n- meet.hn has a twitter page: https://x.com/meet_hn. If you meet IRL thanks to meet.hn, don't hesitate to tag it with a picture, it would mean the world to me.\n- the code is open source: https://github.com/borisghidaglia/meet-hn\n- meet.hn integrates with https://at.hn/ from @padolsey (https://padolsey.at.hn/), registered on meet.hn at https://meet.hn/city/cn-Beijing\nFinally, many thanks to these people for their help and/or feedbacks!\nOrdered alphabetically:\n- https://x.com/ericbureltech\n- https://x.com/fredkisss\n- https://x.com/JulienDuquesne1\n- https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbasseto/\n- https://x.com/lcswillems\n- https://x.com/leeerob\n- https://x.com/padolsey\n- https://x.com/tomlienard\nI hope you will enjoy this!\nPlease share any feedback in the comments.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41539125\nPoints: 508\n# Comments: 253",

GenAI is also useful for\n       identifying areas of dead code, and has promise for better translations\n       of a system between platforms and languages.\nmore…",

My colleagues Alessio\n       Ferri, Tom Coggrave, and Shodhan\n       Sheth have been considering how GenAI can do this,\n       including building an internal tool to help explore the possibilities.\n       The tool uses an LLM to enhance a knowledge graph based on the AST of the\n       code base. It also uses an LLM to help users query this knowledge graph.\n       \nmore…",
