                              <span>A New York Times analysis of more than 3.2 million Telegram messages from 16,000 channels found that the messaging platform has been “inundated” with illegal and extremist activity.
Specifically, The Times found 1,500 channels operated by white supremacists, two dozen channels selling weapons, and at least 22 channels where MDMA, cocaine, heroin and other drugs were advertised for delivery.
The company’s founder and CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France last month, with authorities alleging that Telegram’s lack of content moderation made Durov an accomplice to illegal activity on the platform.
The platform subsequently updated its website to allow abuse reports, and Durov has been posting on his Telegram channel, arguing, “Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach.”</span>

                              <span>Bluesky keeps growing: The company announced that as of Friday morning, it had added 3 million new users, bringing its total user count to more than 9 million.
In other words, the social platform’s user base has grown by around 50 percent in the week or so since a Brazilian court banned X (formerly Twitter). The ban sent Bluesky to the top of the free iPhone app charts in Brazil, where it’s currently ranked number two, behind Meta’s competing app Threads.




In addition to sharing the latest user numbers, Bluesky also assured users old and new that video support is “coming soon.”
The platform started as a Twitter-backed initiative to create an open social protocol, but has since become an independent, venture-backed startup and fully opened to the public in February.
In an earlier post about growth, Bluesky said that 85% of its new users are Brazilian. Bringing on so many new users so quickly has led to occasional technical issues.</span>

                              <span>Warp, a young payroll startup in New York, is in the spotlight following controversial posts from an account tied to the company.
On Thursday, an account posting under the name Vittorio wrote on X, “i like White people more, they do more, they are better for the roles i need to climb the kardashev scale i’ll let blacks run and play basketball.”




The account profile included a badge indicating “Vittorio” was affiliated with Warp, whose software focuses on automating state-by-state tax compliance and was part of the winter 2023 cohort at incubator Y Combinator. The badge is something that X (formerly Twitter) created as part of the X for Business program in 2022 and is usually given to employees, but Warp appears to have distributed it more broadly as part of an unconventional marketing s…</span>

The capsule returned autonomously to Earth without its two crew members, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will remain aboard the station until next February. The space agency determined late last month that the pair will make their journey back to Earth onboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, after Starliner experienced technical issues early in the mission. 




At a post-flight press conference on Saturday, NASA’s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich called the flight “darn near flawless.” He added that the successful mission provoked mixed feelings among staff.

Shaikh went on to study finance, economics and psychology at Hunter College, then got an MBA at University of Rochester. After he graduated, he started to cut his teeth in the professional world at places like BlackRock and Boston Consulting Group.

Carta spokesperson Amanda Taggart told TechCrunch that the company just missed the proper timeline to file its yearly report and pay the corresponding tax.

                              <span>How do you know that the person on the other end of a phone call is really who they say they are? 
Earlier in July, a Ferrari executive was flooded with a barrage of WhatsApp messages that appeared to come from his boss, the carmaker’s CEO, Benedetto Vigna. But the Ferrari executive didn’t recognize the number, and he couldn’t be sure it was really his boss.




Suspicious of the flurry of messages from the unknown number, the Ferrari executive still took a call with the person who claimed to be Vigna. Despite the fact that the purported CEO had Vigna’s southern Italian accent, the executive still felt something was off, so he asked the caller something only Vigna would know, something the two personally discussed days earlier. 
“Sorry, Benedetto, but I need to identify you,” the executive…</span>

The trio came to realize that these artists “made very beautiful things in a very sustainable way,” Nuño recalls, and by the time they were 25, the idea for a business had germinated. They imagined connecting these artists, “their techniques and their stories with the supply chains of global companies looking for more sustainable ways to create products.”

In a scathing resignation letter, BDO subsidiary MSKA highlighted multiple issues with Byju’s, including significant delays in financial reporting, inadequate management support, and concerns over the company’s ability to recover substantial dues from a Dubai-based entity.




The auditor’s exit comes as Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup with a $22 billion valuation, grapples with a series of crises, including a recent Supreme Court decision to resume insolvency proceedings against the startup.

                              <span>A federal judge says he will deliver a punishment in Google’s antitrust case by August 2025, according to The New York Times, after ruling earlier this month that Google had abused its monopoly power over the search industry.
Judge Amit P. Mehta established a timeline for the remedies phase of Google’s antirust trial during a hearing in Washington, D.C. on Friday, the outcome of which could upend how people find information on the internet. Prosecutors have until the end of the year to submit their proposals, which could take aim at Google’s billion-dollar payments to Apple in exchange for priority placement, or potentially order Google to sell off parts of its business.
A lot can change in one year, however, especially given the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Republican and Democratic donors are both reportedly asking the candidates to shake up America’s tough regulatory environment. The outcome of Google Search’s antitrust case could be on the negotiating table in those discussions.</span>

That growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race.




2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI’s new flagship omni model for ChatGPT. GPT-4o is now the default free model, complete with voice and vision capabilities. But after demoing GPT-4o, OpenAI paused one of its voices, Sky, after …</span>

That rocket had been scheduled to launch two spacecraft to Mars for NASA during an eight-day window that opens on October 13. But NASA announced on Friday that it was pushing the mission, called ESCAPADE, to spring 2025, citing potential cost and technical issues with de-fueling the two satellites. New Glenn will now launch some of the company’s own technology in November instead.




The first launch of a new rocket always poses enormous risk, both to the launch vehicle and the payload, and Blue Origin has been racing to get New Glenn ready for launch in a month’s time.

Those crew members, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, closed the hatch on Starliner for the final time earlier today. They’ll be monitoring the spacecraft as it makes its way through the atmosphere this evening, before eventually landing in New Mexico shortly after midnight. 
Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft launched to orbit on June 5. This crewed test mission was the critical final step before the company could start providing regular crew transportation services to the space agency, as part of a $4.2 billion contract it won way back in…</span>

                              <span>Some of Vice President Kamala Harris’s wealthier donors are informally asking for FTC Chair Lina Khan to be replaced, reports Bloomberg. It’s not really surprising: her expansive definition of antitrust enforcement has countless industries frantic, and the largest corporations opposed her appointment from the start.
Khan’s FTC, which has opposed mergers that would have been waved through by previous FTC chairs, has seen mixed success. But her nomination by President Biden in 2021 was clearly a challenge to longstanding doctrines that allowed mega-corporations, including “Big Tech,” to consolidate power. She went so far as to call them “mob bosses” in a recent interview with TechCrunch.
The donor pressure may be misplaced, considering that Khan’s term ends later this month. While she will remain in place until the next agency chief is appointed, chances are this will extend her term by months, not years.
Meanwhile, the donors reportedly also expressed a dislike of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whose term ends in June 2026.</span>

                              <span>Back in 2017, Daniel Lang, Dan Poineau, and Sandra Huber came together to build Mangomint, a startup that makes salon and spa operations software.
Lang said they realized that software providers were trying to build their own booking platforms, à la OpenTable. “We fundamentally didn’t believe this was the right approach for beauty and wellness,” Lang told TechCrunch. The founders envisioned all-in-one software that booked appointments and then automated ongoing text communications that could do everything from appointment reminders to sending care instructions prior to a skincare procedure.

                              <span>The University of Texas at Austin this week announced that it has opened its undergraduate robotics program to high school applicants. The honors program is one of the first in the U.S. that allows incoming freshmen to apply for the program as part of their initial admission application. It’s a clear indication that robotics is no longer in the realm of hyper-specialized graduate and doctorate programs.
The minor is tied to a handful of other majors, including aerospace engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computational engineering, computer science and mechanical engineering. Each forms a foundational piece of an eventual robotics major. With the rise of robotics in high school STEAM teaching, the program is designed to maintain incoming freshmen’s interest in the growing space.</span>

                              <span>Hydrogen startup C-Zero has raised $5 million of an $18 million funding round, according to an SEC filing.
The company is developing a way to strip hydrogen from methane without emitting carbon dioxide. The resulting hydrogen can be used in a range of industries today, including ammonia and petrochemical production, and potentially others in the near future, including transportation and steel production. The solid carbon waste product has the potential to be reused in everything from asphalt to lithium-ion batteries.




C-Zero raised a $34 million round valued at $124 million post-money in 2022, according to PitchBook data. The smaller target for the new round suggests the company is being realistic about its prospects following its sizable haul during the pandemic.
The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The process C-Zero employs is known as methane pyrolysis. C-Zero’s reactor heats natural gas in the presence of a proprietary catalyst to break hydrogen’s chemical bond with the central carbon atom in a methane molecule. 
By using readily available natural gas as the feedstock, C-Zero hopes to produce emission-free hydrogen for less than other green hydrogen startups, which typically rely on expensive electrolyzers powered by low-cost renewable energy from wind and solar. 
Tapping into existing natural gas infrastructure also makes methane pyrolysis a natural fit for petrochemical plants, which today use natural gas throughout their operations and also require large amounts of hydrogen to produce various chemicals.
The potential to sell low-cost, zero-emission hydrogen to large, established customers has caused a flurry of startup activity in the space, many of which use methane pyrolysis. A number of competing startups, including Modern Hydrogen, Molten Industries and ReCarbon, also use the process.</span>

The company is introducing a new program that will give creators a higher share of revenue for their paid experiences on the desktop. Creators will now receive 50% of the revenue for paid experiences that cost $9.99, 60% for experiences that cost $29.99 and 70% for experiences that cost $49.99.

                              <span>Venture capitalist Tim Draper’s international pitch competition, “Meet the Drapers,” is partnering up with TikTok as it heads into its seventh season. Under the new tie-up, entrepreneurs will pitch their startups to the public through the short-form video app for one of the show’s upcoming episodes. The general public will then be able to vote on their favorite submissions through a landing page in the app followed by a livestreamed pitch review on TikTok. This will all culminate in the selection of four finalists, who will compete on an episode of the show in front of judges in hopes of winning the $1 million investment from Tim Draper.
For TikTok, the deal allows the company to position itself as a champion for small businesses at a time when its platform is under an increasingly unpopul…</span>

                              <span>It’s tempting to think the trend of EV startups merging with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to go public has ended, seeing how many of them are struggling or defunct. But that’s not quite true. A startup called Thunder Power Holdings went public on the Nasdaq exchange in June through a SPAC, and is now trying to raise up to $100 million more through a share sale deal. 
All this is happening even as the CEO of the company, Wellen Sham, has been indicted by the Taiwanese government on 11 criminal charges. 




It’s all right there in Thunder Power’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are required for all public companies. Thunder Power spells it out on page 46 of this amended S-4 filing from April, where it explains that the Taipei District Prosecutor’s…</span>

                              <span>Transport for London, the government body overseeing the U.K. capital’s public transit system, said it is experiencing online outages due to an “ongoing cyber security incident” set to drag into the weekend. 
TfL, which runs the London Underground (known as the Tube), buses and trams across London, said that while the city’s public transit system is “operating as usual,” several customer-facing systems are offline, including some ticketing systems and its online real-time Tube arrival information. 




Details of the incident remain scarce. TfL disclosed the cyberattack earlier this week, and said that the government body took action to “prevent further access to its systems.” 
In a brief update on its website on Friday, TfL said it has no evidence yet that any customer data was compromised in the cyberattack. 
A spokesperson for TfL did not respond to a request for comment about what evidence, such as logs, the organization has to determine if any data was stolen. It’s unclear if the organization is able to receive email due to the cyberattack. According to the cyber incident page, TfL says, “many of our staff have limited access to systems and email and, as a result, we may be delayed or unable to respond to your query or any webforms previously submitted.”
According to sources speaking to BBC News, TfL employees have been told to work from home as much of the organization’s back-office systems at its headquarters are affected. 
A review by TechCrunch of TfL’s public-facing web infrastructure shows much of the organization’s systems are no longer online, or have been restricted from accessing the public internet, likely in an effort to isolate the intruders and prevent further access. 




At the time of writing, TechCrunch found several TfL systems, including its employee log-on portal, were still accessible from the internet.</span>

                              <span>Instagram is jazzing up the inbox by adding new features for photo editing, sticker creation, and themes. The company is trying to make Instagram more appealing as a messaging app with features to make conversations more engaging. While some of these features might not sound new, it’s all about removing friction for users that might prevent them from sending a message.
In addition, the inbox — or DMs (direct messages) are a competitive feature for social apps, including those that are taking on Twitter/X. While other startups like Bluesky are integrating DMs directly into their app, Instagram’s X rival Threads is still relying on Instagram’s existing DMs for those who want to connect privately.

The Equity podcast crew is wrapping up another eventful week, with real estate, AI agents, gambling, and secondary markets — which are, of course, a form of legalized gambling.
Mary Ann Azevedo, Becca Szkutak, and Devin Coldewey started off this Friday’s episode with the acknowledgment that the X/Twitter ban situation in Brazil is possibly too complicated an issue to even have an opinion on. Let us cook on that for a bit.




In the deals of the week, Devin first talked about You.com’s $50 million play to take on more difficult AI tasks, things that can’t be solved with a quick Google search. The company is hoping to be the go-to for complex stuff that mixes live search, coding, and natural language understanding — and unlike a lot of its…</span>

                              <span>More antitrust woes for Google. The U.K’.s competition watchdog said on Friday that it suspects the company of adtech antitrust abuses. The tech giant will now have a chance to respond to the provisional findings before the regulator reaches a final decision.
Confirmed violations of U.K. competition law can lead to corrective orders and fines of up to 10% of annual worldwide group turnover. So the outcome of this case is likely to be closely watched.




The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating Google’s role in the adtech stack over suspected abuses of dominance since May 2022. The new development is the sending of a formal statement of objections to Google setting out provisional findings that accuse the adtech giant of self-preferencing its own ad exchang…</span>

                              <span>You can build a reminder and task management system for yourself, and use a service that works for your team. But it might not be easy to get your family members or friends to use the same task management app. iOS app Karo (which means “do it” in Hindi) aims to solve the problem even if the other person doesn’t use the app.
This isn’t Mustafa Yusuf‘s first task management product. The India-based developer also develops another to-do app called Tasks, for more complex task management. Yusuf told TechCrunch that he developed Karo because other apps didn’t allow him the flexibility of assigning tasks to people in your address book.

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s received — and will “examine” — a number of complaints that have been filed under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
“The DPC will now examine the extent to which any processing that has taken place complies with the relevant provisions of the GDPR,” the regulator told TechCrunch. “If, further to that examination, it is established that TUIC [Twitter International Unlimited Company, as X’s main Irish subsidiary is still known] has infringed the GDPR…</span>

- The app is a simple desktop application that works on macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
- I developed this app for my own needs. Getting tired of SaaS app subscriptions and privacy concerns.
- For now, the activities are logged manually or imported from a CSV file. No integration with Plaid or other platforms.
- No monetization is planned for now (only a &quot;buy me a coffee&quot; if you use and appreciate the app).

                              <span>I am depressed and burned out for quite some time already, unfortunately my brain still couldn&#x27;t recover from it.
If I summarize the impact of burnout to my brain:
- Before: I could learn things pretty quickly, come up with solutions to the problems, even be able to see common patterns and see bigger underlying problems
- After: can&#x27;t learn, can&#x27;t work, can&#x27;t remember, can&#x27;t see solutions for trivial problems (e.g. if your shirt is wet, you can change it, but I stare at it thinking when it is going to get dried up)
Take care of your mental health

                              <span>Telegram has quietly updated its policy to allow users to report private chats to its moderators following the arrest of founder Pavel Durov in France over “crimes committed by third parties” on the platform. 
The messaging app, which serves nearly 1 billion monthly active users, has long maintained a reputation for minimal supervision of user interactions.




On Thursday night, Telegram began implementing changes to its moderation policy. “All Telegram apps have ‘Report’ buttons that let you flag illegal content for our moderators — in just a few taps,” the company states on its updated frequently-asked-questions page. 
The platform has also provided an email address for automated takedown requests, instructing users to include links to content requiring moderator attention.
It’s unclear how, and whether, this change impacts Telegram’s ability to respond to requests from law enforcement agencies. The company has previously cooperated with court orders to share some information about its users. 
TechCrunch has reached out to Telegram for comment. 
The Dubai-headquartered company has additionally edited its FAQ page, removing two sentences that previously emphasized its privacy stance on private chats. The earlier version had stated: “All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them.”




These policy changes follow Durov’s arrest by French authorities in connection with an investigation into crimes related to child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking, and fraudulent transactions. 




Responding to his arrest, Durov posted on his Telegram channel, criticizing the action: “Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach.” 
He argued that the established practice for countries dissatisfied with an internet service is to initiate legal action against the service itself, rather than its management.</span>

                              <span>SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell made a public plea to one of Brazil’s top judicial figures on Thursday, asking him to “please stop harassing Starlink” amid the ongoing battle in the country against Elon Musk’s social media business X. 
Musk has been engaged in a months-long dispute with the Brazilian courts, who have been waging a war against X for hosting accounts that the courts say spread extremism and misinformation. 




After X refused to comply with court orders last month asking it to remove certain accounts, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered an immediate, country-wide suspension of the platform. That ban, backed by Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was unanimously upheld earlier this week. 
But the feud has been spilling over to Musk’s other businesses…</span>

                              <span>Launching a phone company is a remarkably difficult — some even say foolish — thing to do. OSOM Products, which rose out of the smoldering ashes of Essential in 2020, is closing shop. Android Authority was first to report the news, after gaining access to an internal announcement from CEO Jason Keats.
OSOM always had a difficult road, with plans to launch a privacy-focused handset. And much like Essential before it, the company dealt with its own legal struggles — namely a lawsuit against filed by a former employee alleging financial mismanagement.




For its part, the company did manage to release a mobile device, though not the first-party phone it had announced. Rather the company lent its technology to a Web3 focused devices from Solana.
OSOM did manage to bring a product to market under its own name. The OSOM Privacy Cable is effectively a USB cord whose data transfer can be disabled in situations where “juice jackers” might be present.
“The report in Android Authority is correct, OSOM is sadly shutting down. In May of 2024, having no customers for a mobile phone despite concerted efforts, OSOM at the time decided to pivot to a new project,” CEO Jason Keats said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “OSOM was forced to let go of a number of employees at that time to reduce our burn rate.”
The “new project” would appear to refer to an “AI-powered camera” it planned as a followup to its unreleased smartphone. According to initial reports, Keating had attempted to sell the company off to HP, but was unable to strike a deal. 
“Unfortunately, given the bleak market climate for fundraising for consumer electronics startups, we were unable to raise a new round,” Keats says. “While some maintenance operations to ensure contractual requirements will proceed, OSOM’s general operations will shut down on September 6.”</span>

Own is Salesforce’s biggest deal since buying Slack for $27.7 billion in 2021. The company reportedly considered — but ultimately decided against — purchasing data management software firm Informatica earlier this year.

The indictment names Russian GRU colonel and commanding officer of cyber operations, Yuriy Denisov; lieutenants Vladislav Borovkov, Denis Denisenko, Dmitriy Goloshubov and Nikolay Korchagin; and a civilian co-conspirator Amin Sitgal, who was previously indicted for some of the same crimes.

                              <span>The advancement of generative AI tools has created a new problem for the internet: the proliferation of synthetic nude images resembling real people. On Thursday, Microsoft took a major step to give revenge porn victims a tool to stop its Bing search engine from returning these images.
Microsoft announced a partnership with StopNCII, an organization that allows victims of revenge porn to create a digital fingerprint of these explicit images, real or not, on their device. StopNCII’s partners then use that digital fingerprint, or “hash” as it’s technically known, to scrub the image from their platforms. Microsoft’s Bing joins Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, PornHub, and OnlyFans in partnering with StopNCII, and using its digital fingerprints to stop the spread of reve…</span>

Vay isn’t traditional a ride-hailing or car sharing startup, nor does it operate a robotaxi service. And yet, when customers in Las Vegas or Berlin open the Vay app and hail a car, it arrives without a human behind the wheel.




The Berlin-based startup, which was founded in 2019 and has raised about $110 million to date, has developed teleoperations technology that allows employees sitting in an office to pilot empty vehicles to customers. Once the Vay vehicle arrives, the customer hops in and takes over manual control of the car. Customers drive themselves to t…</span>

It was an arrangement that basically worked: the company grew to have a 13% share of the country’s total exports, making it the largest sesame seed exporter in the market. Yet despite sending seeds to customers in 40 countries, it’s still firmly a medium-sized enterprise, with last year’s revenues clearing just $83 million. 
And it was facing a problem: when Chandarana thought about how he might expand the operation, his bank-based financial arrangement came up short.

The feature, which allows users to ask the AI to find photos using more complex queries, will initially be available in “early access” to select customers in the U.S. before expanding to a wider user base.
Powered by Google’s Gemini AI model, Ask Photos lets users search their photos using natural language queries that leverage the AI’s understanding of their photo’s content and other metadata. Previously, Google Photos users could search for particular people, places or things in their photos, but the AI upgrade will allow them to ask a larger variety of questions, including those that require a deeper understanding of the photos…</span>

                              <span>Copper is critical to the energy transition away from fossil fuels. The metal is an excellent conductor of electricity, used in everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines. But by the end of the decade, the International Energy Agency expects copper supplies to fall 20% short of demand.
One stealthily operating startup thinks it can narrow the gap by helping miners extract more copper from their mines. To do that, Colorado-based Endolith is turning to microbes.




Today, most copper is recovered using hydrometallurgy, which generally involves pouring acid on piles of rock, which strips out some portion of the copper. Endolith supplements that, adding what are essentially domesticated microbes that can boost the amount of copper that leaches out of the pile.

AI, on the other hand, may not be creative, but it is pretty good at exactly those routine tasks. 
All Hands AI, which announced a $5 million seed funding round led by Menlo Ventures on Thursday, aims to build model-agnostic open source AI agents that can handle most of this toil and allow developers to focus more of their time on doing what they do best.

Once mostly in the form of PDFs and static plaintext, docs today are more interactive and user-friendly than they used to be.
But crafting them is still a time sink. Han Wang and Hahnbee Lee, both devs and entrepreneurs, say that they’ve personally struggled with this.




“In the 2010s, companies like Stripe, Hashicorp, Twilio and a bunch others raised the bar on developer content,” Wang said. “They proved that a truly great developer experience for their content is not just a commodity, but a competitive advantage. Since then, every company has been trying to catch up, but it’s actually quite difficult.”

The idea with a product it unveiled last week, called PhariaAI, is to help other companies or the public sector use AI tools regardless of whether it made the underlying tech. “The world changed,” Andrulis told Bloomberg. “Just having an European LLM is not sufficient as a business model. It doesn’t justify the investment.”
Aleph Alpha raised a $500 million Series B round last November. But with category giants like OpenAI having far beefier war chests to fuel development — and, closer to home, France’s Mistral has also raked in more investor cash — the German startup had its work cut out to stay in the LLM fight.</span>

                              <span>Over the past few months, tech execs like Elon Musk have touted the performance of their company’s AI models on a particular benchmark: Chatbot Arena.
Maintained by a non-profit known as LMSYS, Chatbot Arena has become something of an industry obsession. Posts about updates to its model leaderboards garner hundreds of views and reshares across Reddit and X, and the official LMSYS X account has over 54,000 followers. Millions of people have visited the organization’s website in the last year alone.




Still, there are some lingering questions about Chatbot Arena’s ability to tell us how “good” these models really are.

Before we dive in, let’s take a moment to understand what LMSYS is exactly, and how it became so popular.

                              <span>Every automaker is aiming to build and sell the so-called software-defined vehicle. Rivian may have actually done it, but getting there wasn’t easy. Just ask Rivian’s chief of software Wassym Bensaid.
In a bid to drive down manufacturing costs and improve the performance of its EVs, Rivian changed 600 parts on its flagship R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck. The company left the exterior mostly untouched and instead reworked the guts, including the electrical architecture and a redesigned software user interface that provides detailed illustration-like graphics using Unreal Engine as well as deeper integration with Apple and Google.




Bensaid, who joined the EV maker in 2019, drove the creation of the vertically integrated software stack at Rivian. In other words, Bensaid knows a thing or two …</span>

According to the company, dresses were one of the most searched apparel categories for the tool. However, as Google explained in today’s blog post, its current diffusion technique is challenging to use with dresses, as they are more detailed and complex compared to other clothing items. 




To provide more context, Google Shopping released the tool last year, using its own diffusion technology to create high-quality, lifelike images of tops and blouses. It simulates how the clothing would drape, fold, cling, and form wrinkles and shadows on real people in…</span>

                              <span>Until six years ago, many e-commerce and SaaS businesses could have avoided paying sales tax to states where they had customers, but no physical presence. But as online shopping grew, states realized they were losing out on tax revenue.
The era of free-riding for online retailers ended in 2018 when South Dakota took Wayfair to court over sales tax collection. The Supreme Court ultimately sided with South Dakota. 




Now, online stores and SaaS companies have to collect sales tax from their customers wherever it’s required, which is not an easy task given that tax laws vary significantly by city, county and state.
Rohit Bhadange, who worked in venture capital and private equity, identified sales tax compliance as a major pain point for e-commerce and SaaS businesses. So, about 18 months ag…</span>

The announcement comes as YouTube has faced criticism over the past few years for potentially harming teens and exposing them to content that could encourage eating disorders. 




The type of content that YouTube will limit exposure to includes videos that compare physical features and idealize certain fitness levels, body types and weight. Separately, YouTube will also limit exposure to videos that display “social aggression” in the form of non-contact fights and intimidation. 
The Google-owned platform notes that this type of content…</span>

One key component of the new detection technology involved the expansion of YouTube’s existing Content ID system, which today identifies copyright-protected material. This system will be expanded to include new synthetic-singing identification technology to identify AI content that simulates someone’s singing voice. Other detection technologies will be developed to identify when someone’s face is simulated with AI, the company says.

                              <span>Hiring platform ZipRecruiter is launching a new tool, called ZipIntro, to let employers schedule introductory calls with potential candidates at a set time. The tool will also help recruiters suggest potential candidates using AI.
Employers can input information about the role and select a date and time for introductory calls. After that, ZipIntro matches them with potential candidates using AI and sends them an invitation for the call. The tool takes into account employment, education, skills, certifications, interests, and types of jobs users are looking for while matching.

Employers can review these responses from candidates, further screen candidates, and line up back-to-back calls. ZipRecruiter then allows employers to connect with candidates through one-on-one video calls on the platform.




The company said these intro sessions are typically 30-minute to 1-hour long, with each intro call lasting about five minutes. It noted that while these are initial screening calls, some organizations also use this tool to hire high-volume roles that may require fewer interview stages.

ZipRecruiter noted that with ZipIntro, employers get their first RSVP from candidates within 20 minutes of posting the job requirement. 
“With ZipIntro, recruiters and hiring managers can forge those critical connections faster to assess the true potential of each candidate,” Megan Allen, SVP of product at ZipRecruiter said in a statement. “For job seekers, we’re excited to provide them with the opportunity to speak with an employer faster, allowing them to showcase their true personality, soft skills, and passion.”
The company is not the only platform utilizing AI to make the hiring process easier. Indeed is also using AI to help people write about their job experiences. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has deployed an AI tool to help recruiters write better job descriptions.</span>

                              <span>In 2017, DJI introduced the Spark. With a palm-sized body, gesture control and a sub-$500 price point, the system was firmly targeted at social media. It was, in essence, a selfie-drone.
The little quadcopter built up a fanbase, though apparently not one large enough to justify its own continued existence. DJI quietly discontinued the device in 2019, replacing it with the Mavic Mini, the smallest member of its wildly popular folding consumer drone line.




This week at IFA in Berlin, DJI is once again going small with the new Neo. Like the Spark before it, the drone’s ability to land in the palm of the user’s hand is a major selling point. Among other things, that’s shorthand for Neo’s small footprint: At 135 grams (0.3 pound), DJI says its the “most compact and lightest” drone it has pro…</span>

                              <span>Brittany Ennix first became interested in supply chains as a child. 
Her grandfather worked for the Ford glass manufacturing plant, where she says he gave her an appreciation for the complexity of building something. When Ennix moved to Silicon Valley and worked for Uber and later Flexport, her fascination for the industry grew, until she had an idea for how make the supply chains more efficient for small and mid-sized businesses. 




“Most of us don’t think about supply chains on a day-to-day basis, but they truly shape everything from what we can buy, where we can buy it, where we live, at what price, which is obviously very top of mind in this economy,” Ennix told TechCrunch. 
Nearly three years ago, she started working on Portex, a company that allows small-to-mid-sized businesses (SM…</span>

Frontier offers internet, phone and TV services — it has also partnered with companies like Google and Amazon over the years to bundle other digital services or find new distribution channels. But Verizon’s big interest in the company is its fiber business and the fact that it extends to places that Verizon does not currently cover as well.

With the cost of compliance averaging out to around $10,000 per employee these days, many firms are searching for ways to reduce spending without running afoul of regulators. Entrepreneurs Nir Laznik and Eyal Peleg say that they’ve created a solution — powered by generative AI, as is the trend.

                              <span>European regulators are pushing hard for greener energy. The REPowerEU plan calls for 10 million additional heat pumps to be added by 2027, and solar panels are also on the rise. 
But most installations are done by small businesses that could be more productive with better work processes.




This is where German startup Reonic comes in. “We give renewable installers the tools to be extremely efficient, and we do that mainly by providing them with planning and workflow software,” said co-founder Tristan Menzinger (sitting on the right in the picture above).
Menzinger, Lars-Manuel Schneider (sitting in the middle in the picture above), and their university mate and third co-founder Udo Sill all worked at a research institute exploring renewable energy deployment. It sparked their interest i…</span>

Boom is a bootstrapped company built by former Shopify employees Robleh Jama and Krishna Satya. The app works with all major video conferencing apps, including Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Once installed, you can add customized themes to your video call appearances, including your name, designation, location, time, and weather.




Plus, it lets you react through on-screen effects, stickers, and GIFs during calls. You can tweak your appearance, too, with controls for things like brightness, contrast, saturation, shadow, hu…</span>

Or maybe this:


kanye actually invented founder mode pic.twitter.com/zKmHM9jk8P

You may even have seen this parody about “goblin mode.”
The chatter ties to a recent blog post that Y Combinator founder and dispenser of startup wisdom Paul Graham wrote about how founders like Airbnb’s Brian Chesky often ignore conventional wisdom regarding running a company at scale. That conventional wisdom — hire great people and let them do their thing — actually often turns into “hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground,” Graham says.
Of course, he can’t say exactly what founder mode looks like because every founder does it differently, but he hopes that it will someday be as widely taught as manager mode. In the meantime, the hot takes on his hot take continue.


it’s called “founder mode” it’s about how to run your company as a founder and how that often goes against traditional management practices. it’s basically what i already do but paul graham created a cool name for it in his latest essay. you know who paul graham is? y combinator? pic.twitter.com/rMKo9iGk6P

Miami — once a hotspot for crypto, an area of interest for a16z — has struggled to retain venture cash and entrepreneurial talent in recent years, Bloomberg notes, with venture investments dwindling to $400 million in Q2 2024 from $5.5 billion in all of 2022, per Pitchbook.
For a16z, the closure deals a blow to plans it outlined in 2022 to ditch a central HQ for “global outposts” in cities including NYC and Santa Monica. Pitched as an antidote to the remote working arrangements that became commonplace during the pandemic (which a16z co-founders Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen once derided as “not a good life“), the outposts were meant to “build relationships” amid founders and help “develop [a16z’s]” culture.
Evidently, things didn’t go quite as planned in Miami.</span>

The high-stakes mission is now set to officially conclude on Friday, with Starliner making its undocking attempt around 6:04 p.m. EST. Should all go to plan, the spacecraft will land at New Mexico’s White Sands Space Harbor approximately six hours later.

Sometimes, other teens would forget to log out of their accounts, and we would post something like “i just pooped” before signing into our own accounts.
This isn’t the case anymore. In 2014, the Pew Research Center estimated that 71% of U.S. teens used Facebook; as of 2022, that percentage dropped to 32%, then slightly increased to 33% last year.

That includes €1 million in debt facilities.
While the amount isn’t as impressive as some of Cowboy’s previous fundraises, the company has been looking for an investor outside of the traditional European VC firms that have already invested in the startup — an investor that could potentially open new doors. As a result, Cypress Capital is leading the round. The Hong Kong-based investment firm has strong ties with Taiwan, which is a key hub for the global bicycle industry.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of Paylocity’s fiscal year, which would be sometime in the next 30 to 60 days. It is being funded by borrowings under Paylocity’s revolving credit facility.




It’s a decent exit for seven-year-old Airbase, which was founded by Thejo Kote in 2017 to provide software to midsized companies seeking to better manage their spending. Its platform included bill payments, corporate cards, and employee reimbursements, among other things.

                              <span>A long-running lawsuit over the Internet Archive’s “emergency” e-book lending practices during the COVID-19 pandemic has ended in a loss for the website and a victory for publishers.
The lawsuit concerned the Internet Archive’s National Emergency Library, a program it established at the beginning of the pandemic to allow wider access to some 1.3 million e-books. Previously only able to be checked out one at a time, books were later able to be “borrowed” by many people at once.




The publishers, which already had an uneasy relationship with both the Internet Archive and the digital book-lending community in general, sued soon after in June 2020. The publishers contended that going from single-user borrowing to limitless borrowing essentially turned the system from a notional library into …</span>

                              <span>Ryan Breslow’s plan to get himself reinstalled as CEO of fintech company Bolt — and push through a $450 million fundraising deal that would value the startup at a staggering $14 billion — has apparently stalled.
According to Forbes, Breslow sent an email to shareholders thanking them for signing off on the deal. The problem is that many of those investors, including Montauk Ventures and Ash Pournouri, claim they didn’t sign off on anything. Montauk’s founder, Philip Krim, told Forbes he does not support the financing, and Breslow didn’t have his permission to be included in a list of investors that had approved the deal.
Meanwhile, BlackRock, along with Hedosophia and Untitled Ventures, reportedly applied for a restraining order in an attempt to “halt” Bolt’s Series F round. The trio claimed through an attorney that Bolt was “coercing its investors by forcing them to choose between paying millions of dollars for new stock or losing most of their existing investment.”
Bolt declined TechCrunch’s request for comment.</span>

My Drama is a new short series app with more than 30 shows, with a majority of them following a soap opera format in order to hook viewers. The app is now launching an AI-powered chatbot for viewers to get to know the characters in depth, bringing it in closer competition with companies like Character.AI, the a16z-backed chatbot startup.




The short drama app was developed by Holywater, a Ukraine-based media tech startup founded by Bogdan Nesvit (CEO) and Anatolii Kasianov (CTO). The parent company also operates a reading app called My Passion, mainly known for its romance titles. 
Since its launch in April, My Drama has rapidly gained traction, boasting 1 million users and $3 mi…</span>

                              <span>A 23-year-old woman who allegedly killed two men in March while using Ford’s hands-free system, BlueCruise, has been charged with DUI homicide by Pennsylvania State Police. The woman, Dimple Patel, turned herself in on Tuesday.
Patel was also charged with homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, tampering with evidence, careless driving, reckless driving and prohibited text-based communications, according to a report sent by Pennsylvania State Police. Patel was driving on Interstate 95 at around 3:20 am ET when the crash occurred. She was traveling at about 71 miles per hour in her 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E with the BlueCruise hands-free driving feature and Adaptive Cruise Control systems activated at the time of the crash.




The men, identified as Aktilek Baktybekov and Tolobek Esenbekov, had pulled over to the left side of the highway and exited their vehicles. Patel rear-ended one of the cars and killed both of the men.
In a statement, the Pennsylvania State Police urged drivers to always stay alert and limit distractions when driving. 
“No partially automated vehicle technology should ever be left alone to perform the driving tasks that are required to safely navigate the roads of the Commonwealth,” according to the statement sent to TechCrunch. “While the advancements in technology are immense, always strive to maintain proper control of your vehicle. If you are driving hands free, be aware and ready to regain control if the situation warrants your immediate reaction.”
The fatal crash in Pennsylvania — along with another one that happened in Texas in February — is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation. It’s one of a number of ongoing efforts to scrutinize the use of partial automation. But it’s one of the first cases where charges have been brought against the driver, who is supposed to supervise the driver assistance system’s performance and take over if it is about to crash.</span>

The jobs on X’s safety team range from director of strategic response on X’s safety team to government affairs managers. On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist.

This week in AI, two startups developing tools to generate and suggest code — Magic and Codeium — raised nearly half a billion dollars combined. The rounds were high even by AI sector standards, especially considering that Magic hasn’t launched a product or generated revenue yet.




So why the investor enthusiasm? Well, coding isn’t an easy — or inexpensive — business. And there’s demand from both companies and individual developers for ways to streamline the more arduous processes around it.
According to one survey, the average dev spends close to 20% of their workweek maintaining existing code rather than writing anything new. In a separate study, companies said that…</span>

In a blog post, McCord, Cosmos’ chair, said that the Institute will found an AI lab at the University of Oxford called the Human-Centered AI Lab, or “HAI Lab” for short. It’ll be led by Oxford philosopher Philipp Koralus — another of the Institute’s founding fellows — and aim to “translate the philosophical principles of human flourishing into open source software and AI systems.”

                              <span>YouTube is expanding its existing set of parental controls with a new feature that would allow a parent to link their account to their teen’s account in order to gain insight into the teen’s activity across the video-sharing platform, the company announced on Wednesday. Once linked, parents will be alerted to their teen’s channel activity, including the number of uploads, subscriptions, and comments — not the content. They’ll also receive email notifications about events, like a new upload or livestream.
The company tells TechCrunch that the act of linking the account won’t influence the YouTube algorithm in terms of what’s shown to the teen, however, as that’s already personalized to the user. Parents also aren’t able to inform YouTube of the child’s real age via the act of account linkin…</span>

                              <span>No one is putting the remote working genie back in the bottle. Which is good news for Oyster, a payroll and HR platform that specializes in distributed workforces – or “global employment” as its marketing paints it. The 2019-founded U.S. startup has just closed a $59 million Series D funding round led by Silver Lake Waterman. 
The new funding, which brings its total raised to date to $286 million, sees its valuation increase slightly – up to $1.2 billion vs the $1B it was valued at back in 2022 (when it raised its $150M Series C). This means Oyster has maintained its market value at a time when many other tech companies have been forced into down-rounds – bucking a painful trend.

                              <span>For the college students who are satisfied with dating apps, which may not be many, Tinder announced Wednesday a series of updates to Tinder U, its in-app feature that caters to current college students ages 18 to 24. This includes new badges to add to their profiles, such as graduation year, major, clubs, and Greek life. Other smaller updates include more simplified enrollment for students and an exclusive Tinder U app icon for iOS users. 
Tinder is also offering U.S. students 50% off any Tinder premium subscription — Plus, Gold, or Platinum — in hopes of gaining more paid users to the platform after losing 400,000 paid users this past quarter. 




Additionally, it’s that time of year when Tinder hosts its annual “Swipe Off” challenge, where the college or university with the most swipe …</span>

X agreed to suspend its processing of European users’ data for AI model training in early August after Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) initiated legal action against the Elon Musk-owned company in relation to consentless use of people’s information to train its AI chatbot, Grok.

Now, as it looks to revive its advertising business, its new incarnation X is hoping for a rerun. The company announced a new TV app available “on several app stores” as part of a wider effort to court more advertisers, creators, and partners around a “video-first platform.” 
That pivot into video will also include a new video tab on X itself, it added. The tab has yet to launch. 




Users are noting that a beta of the TV app is already appearing on Amazon Fire TV and Google TV; we’ve been able to confirm we can see the Amazon Fire TV app ourselves. No sign of the app yet on Apple TV, Roku or other TV platforms.

The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus. But for people who won’t be present in person, they can tune in here or watch the stream on Apple’s website.




We expect to see new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models, as well as updates to the Apple Watch, AirPods and perhaps even new Macs, although those are a big “maybe.”  
Apple unveiled its AI suite, Apple Intelligence, at WWDC 2024 and has rolled out some features to the 15 Pro models through developer betas. These features will make their way to consumers with the public release of iOS 18. Plus, Apple might offer some Apple Intelligence-powered features exclusively for the iPhone 16 lineup.
As always, TechCrunch will be covering the event, bringing you news as it happens.</span>

During normal operation, the wheel maintains a standard rigid circular form. When it encounters an obstacle, however, it becomes compliant, conforming to the object’s height and shape.
The system, which also appeared in Science Robotics, is surrounded by a “smart chain” structure attached to spokes that alter tension when the chain encounters variations in terrain. The team says the project was inspired by the surface tension properties of water droplets. No word on when — or if — such a system might be commercialized.</span>

The firm is again trying to do something that it sees as unique. On Wednesday, Mayfield said it is launching AI Garage, a $100 million initiative for ideation-stage founders interested in building “AI teammate” companies.

                              <span>Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the AI startup co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised over $1 billion in capital from investors including NFDG (an investment partnership run by Nat Friedman and SSI CEO Daniel Gross), a16z, Sequoia, DST Global and SV Angel.
SSI told Reuters that it plans to use the tranche to acquire computing power and hire researchers and engineers split between Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. As to what exactly they’ll research, SSI isn’t saying quite yet.
Reuters, citing a source familiar, says that the new funding values SSI at $5 billion. 
Prior to SSI, Sutskever headed the now-dismantled Superalignment team at OpenAI, which focused on general AI safety research. Sutskever quietly departed OpenAI months after a highly-publicized fallout between him, several former OpenAI board members and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over what Sutskever has referred to as a “breakdown in communications.”</span>

                              <span>The American sports betting market produced $10.9 billion in revenue in 2023 for casinos, sportsbooks and iGaming, according to the American Gambling Association. One of the reasons this industry is so lucrative is because the majority of people who bet on sports lose. A three-year-old San Francisco-based startup called DubClub is trying to change that.
“When betting on sports, you are at a structural disadvantage versus the sportsbooks,” DubClub co-founder and CEO Ryan Gaertner, told TechCrunch. “They have more data than the average person. Those companies make money when people lose.”




DubClub hopes to help amateur betters win more by finding experts that may help them better understand which bets to make. DubClub is a platform where amateur sports betters can subscribe to professiona…</span>

Founded in 2007, Dutch firm SET Ventures is one of the latter. Its fourth fund, which just closed at €200 million, is twice the size of its previous one, and will be deployed into 20 to 25 European startups making renewable energy more mainstream.
SET’s name, pronounced “set,” stands for Sustainable Energy Technologies. Its long track record of investing in European climate-focused startups and article 9 status, which requires a commitment to sustainability as a goal, helped it attract more capital than ever from a mix of corporate and institutional LPs.

Even enterprises with robust data analytics and orchestration tools seemed to be having a rough go of it, Agrawal and Gupta say. Maybe so. According to a Deloitte study, 67% of managers aren’t comfortable accessing insights from data analytics platforms, partly due to tech-related challenges.

The Norwegian company has been something of an unlikely success story.

But despite swimming upstream, the company has prospered, growing and funding itself without resorting to venture capital, something few startups can say.

Today, the ride-hail company is doubling down on its docked scooter and bikeshare operations, positioning itself as the ideal partner for cities looking to enhance their urban transportation networks. 
Since acquiring shared bike and station provider PBSC Urban Solutions two years ago, Lyft has invested in building and deploying better quality e-bikes and docked e-scooters, as well as a new type of docking station that is solar-powered, modular and able to charge both bikes and scooters.

                              <span>Spotify is launching daylist globally. It’s a personalized playlist that evolves throughout the day depending on your listening habits. This rollout comes after the company introduced it first to English-speaking markets last year. The playlist will be available to both free and premium users.
The company said it is also adding support for 14 additional languages, including Arabic, Catalan, French (Canada), French (France), German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), and Turkish.




Spotify introduced daylist in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Ireland in September 2023. In March 2024, the feature was made available in 65 more countries, and now the company is launching the feature in all the markets where Spotify is available.
Spotify noted that after the expansion in March, 70% of daylist users come back weekly to access the playlist. However, the company didn’t specify how many users overall have used this feature or how much music discovery it is driving.
Users can access daylist in the Spotify app through the “Made for You” section or on the web through this link. The playlist and its title update throughout the day with some goofy ones like “bedroom pop banger early morning” or “90s rave rainforest late night.” At the time of launch, Spotify said that it uses data of “niche music and microgenres” that you listen to at a particular time of the day to suggest tracks and update the daylist. 
Users can also save a particular playlist they like by tapping on the three dot menu, selecting “Add to playlist” option, and tapping on “New Playlist” to save that exact daylist to their library.</span>

                              <span>Cycle Time is a measure of how long it takes to get a new feature in a
  software system from idea to running in production. In Agile circles, we try
  to minimize cycle time. We do this by defining and implementing very small
  features and minimizing delays in the development process. Although the rough
  notion of cycle time, and the importance of reducing it, is common, there is a
  lot of variations on how cycle time is measured.


A key characteristic of agile software development is a shift from a
  Waterfall Process, where work is decomposed based on
  activity (analysis, coding, testing) to an Iterative Process where work is
  based on a subset of functionality (simple pricing, bulk discount,
  valued-customer discount). Doing this generates a feedback loop where we can learn

                              <span>Digital lending platforms have become an easy and swift alternative source of credit for microenterprises and individuals overlooked by traditional banking institutions. These platforms have turned into a lifeline for millions of underbanked and demand will keep growing, pushing the value of the digital lending platform market in the Middle East and Africa to reach $2 billion in the next five years, recording a four-fold growth since 2021.
This is the market opportunity Ghanaian fintech Fido plans to tap as it explores new markets in East and Southern Africa, sustained by fresh $30 million Series B debt-equity funding. The new capital includes a $20 million equity injection from global impact investment manager BlueOrchard and Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO.

According to the British-American global asset firm, which disclosed how it values its shares in the Indian startup in a securities filing, PharmEasy’s implied valuation at the end of June was about $458 million. 




That’s surprising because in April the startup said it had launched a rights issue to raise about $417 million. The rights issue, which allows existing investors to buy new shares in the firm at a much lower valuation, was oversubscribed, PharmEasy co-founder Dharmil Sheth said in a LinkedIn post.

Christian Sobkowski, meanwhile, recalls his days working in financial services, most notably at PayPal, where helped expand the company’s business across Europe.




It’s no wonder then, that the two decided to come together as co-CEOs, pairing their financial backgrounds to create a company that, in hindsight, would have made Pannu’s former day job much easier.
“With Treasury teams deciding how the largest corporations move cash around the world, it became obvious that guiding those money flows was worthy of bringing the best talent to re-think how it’s done,” Sobkowski told TechCrunch.

                              <span>Canva, the design platform, is increasing prices steeply for some customers. And it’s blaming the move in part on generative AI.
In the U.S., some Canva Teams subscribers on older pricing plans are seeing the sticker price for a five-person plan jump from $119.99 per year to $500 per year (with a 40% discount for the first 12 months). In Australia, meanwhile, the flat $39.99 AUS (about $26) per-month fee for up to five users has been raised to $13.50 AUS for each user. 




On an individual user basis, Canva Teams prices are now $100 per person, or $10 a month per person, with a minimum of three people required for a Teams plan. Those prices were quietly changed earlier this year for new customers, but now the company is changing the price for customers who’d previously paid a lower price.…</span>

                              <span>Sometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 “It’s Glowtime” event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays.
The livestream kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most.

The CEO says the simplified version aims to improve the platform’s accessibility and usability. For those that remember Snapchat’s 2018 redesign, this news may do little to stoke confidence.
Spiegel attempted to rally employee spirits with his letter on Tuesday after a depressing year for the company’s stock price, which has fallen nearly 50% in 2024. 




“Investors are concerned that we aren’t growing faster,” said Spiegel in the letter.
The “simplified” Snapchat may be an attempt to capture older users, who are historically perplexed by the app’s not-so-intuitive design. Snapchat does a lot better at attracting younger audiences, who seem to just get t…</span>

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a report about increasing fraud at Bitcoin ATMs. These ATMs allow people to turn their cash into crypto, but they’ve become a tool for scammers to perpetrate fraud. Since 2020, the FTC says, fraud at Bitcoin ATMs has ballooned nearly tenfold, and just in the first half of 2024, consumers have lost more than $66 million to these scams.
Scammers use tactics like fake phone calls, messages and security alerts to convince people that they’re in danger, and that they should deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM to protect it. Then, the scammer may share a QR code to scan at the Bitcoin ATM, which deposits the cash into the scammer’s wallet.</span>

                              <span>Volkswagen is taking its ChatGPT voice assistant experiment on the road. Or more, specifically to vehicles it sells in the United States. 
The German automaker announced in January at CES 2024 plans to add an AI-powered chatbot into all Volkswagen models equipped with its IDA voice assistant. But the U.S. was excluded in that initial rollout.




Now, the automaker is making its ChatGPT-integrated Plus Speech voice assistant — which is an AI chatbot based on Cerence’s Chat Pro product and a large language model from OpenAI — available in new U.S. vehicles. The rollout begins September 6 with the 2025 
2025 Jetta and Jetta GLI models, along with 2024 ID.4 vehicles equipped with an 82-kWh battery. Most 2025 models will offer Plus Speech with AI as they enter the market.
Caveat: A subscription required, although the ID.4 and ID Buzz comes with three years of free access.</span>

As new users downloaded the app, Bluesky jumped to becoming the app to No. 1 in Brazil over the weekend, ahead of Meta’s X competitor, Instagram Threads.

The big story


Flat-fee real estate
There’s a whole lot of fintech in the real estate world. And last week, I got the scoop on a new startup called Landian that emerged from stealth to take advantage of recent rule changes related to real estate commissions. In fact, one of its co-founders is also one of the people who successfully sued the National Association of Realtors (NAR) to help facilitate those changes. Buyers have t…</span>

                              <span>Instagram’s latest feature aims to boost user interaction within Stories. The social media platform now allows followers to comment on each other’s Stories, making the experience more community-focused, akin to livestreaming where users can engage in larger discussions.
A few users have already spotted the feature, including marketing strategist Taylor Loren (@taylor.loren on Threads). Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted a screenshot in the company’s Channel. (See below). 




Instagram notes that users will be able to disable the option to have comments posted on their Stories, if they prefer. 


The new feature seems to have been inspired by user behavior. Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, has previously expressed how the Stories format is one of the app’s most popular features and is more widely used than posting content to the main feed. Private messaging is also highly favored by many users who prefer engaging in closed groups with their friends.
The addition of public comments to Stories is part of Instagram’s ongoing efforts to increase engagement on the platform. Most recently, the company added the ability to add music to profiles. There’s also a new feature called “Reveal” that allows users to hide Stories so that followers can only see them after sending a DM.</span>

This second fund is significant because Gupta expanded it beyond a corporate fund with one main LP – Prudential Financial – into one supported by a number of financial and insurance LPs. Prudential Financial is the lead investor but the fund also includes TIAA, Lincoln Financial, Generali, Nippon Life, Mutual of Omaha and Willis Towers Watson. Prudential was the solo LP in Pruven’s first fund of $300 million.

In a brief filing with government regulators on Tuesday, Halliburton said it was “evaluating the nature and scope of the [stolen] information,” and what data breach notifications it is required to make.




Halliburton last week said it took some of its systems offline following the detection of the cyberattack. The company now says it is “working to identify effects of the incident” on its ongoing oil and fracking operations.
When contacted on Tuesday, Halliburton spokesperson Amina Rivera did not comment or say if the company knows what kinds of data were stolen. “We are not commenting beyond what was included in our filing,” said Riv…</span>

The court will issue fines of up to $9,000 to those who use VPNs to get around that ban. But the debate and drama have not ended there. Mike Masnick over at TechDirt weighs up how the case highlights the complexities of supporting free speech and complying with so-called “hostage laws,” but also how Musk himself, owner of “ExTwitter,” has played different sides depending on what suits him best. Meanwhile, Musk says his satellite communications company Starlink and his other companies have had their assets frozen, as well.</span>

From a scientific perspective, ridding those industries of fossil fuels is possible; economically, it’s not. Or at least not yet, claims a young startup. Oxylus Energy thinks it has the key to one part of the equation.  




The company was spun out of a Yale chemistry lab last year, and it has been working to refine the production of so-called green methanol. Today, most methanol is derived from fossil fuels and used to make petrochemicals, though it can also be used as a transportation fuel. Because of that flexibility, green methanol, which is made without fossil fuels, could rid carbon pollution from a range of industries.

He is replacing Philippe Laffont, the founder of the New York-based investment firm Coatue Management, on ByteDance’s board, per the report. Coatue has been considering selling a portion of its stake in ByteDance, according to a report by The Information on August 23. 
Niel is the owner of French telecom company Iliad. He has also been an active startup investor with his seed investment firm Kima Ventures and through other investment vehicles.

                              <span>Clearview AI, the controversial U.S.-based, facial recognition startup that built a searchable database of 30 million images populated by scraping the internet for people’s selfies without their consent, has been hit with its largest privacy fine yet in Europe.
The Netherlands’ data protection authority, Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (AP), said on Tuesday that it has imposed a penalty of €30.5 million — around $33.7M at current exchange rates — on Clearview AI for a raft of breaches of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) after confirming the database contains images of Dutch citizens.




This fine is larger than separate GDPR sanctions imposed by data protection authorities in France, Italy, Greece and the U.K. back in 2022.

                              <span>X, the social network owned by Elon Musk, is finally rolling out one of the most sought-after features for direct messages: the ability to edit the message.
Over the weekend, X made the edit message feature available to iOS users. One of the engineers at the company posted about the roll-out and said the edit messages function will be available on more platforms soon.


save yourself from your own bad decisions (or typos) (or both)
DM edits are here. you’re welcome https://t.co/RzELFRZgfY
— X (@X) August 31, 2024


Here is how you can use it:
Open any direct message chat from your X iOS app.
Long press on any message that you sent or tap on the three-dot menu beside the message.
Select the “Edit message” option to modify the sent message.
According to a support page, there is no time limit for editing the messages. In our testing, we found out that you can also edit older DMs on the platform too. However, you can only make five edits overall to a message. The social network applies the same limit on editing posts as well.




While X said that it keeps a log of edited messages for security reasons, it doesn’t show the version history of edited messages at the moment. 
Users expect to be able to edit their messages in messaging apps, as other chat apps, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Messenger have had this functionality for a while now. Apple also added the ability to edit messages sent via iMessage with iOS 16.</span>

                              <span>In June 2021, Ziina, fresh from completing YC’s first cohort that year and securing a $7.5 million seed, launched its fintech app to 20,000 retail customers, allowing them to send and receive money. 
Three years later, the Dubai-based startup, which now counts 50,000 retail and business customers after expanding its offerings to meet the needs of micro, small, and medium-sized businesses in the UAE, has netted $22 million in Series A funding led by Altos Ventures.




Indeed, such sizable follow-on funding despite the global funding slowdown underscores investors’ confidence in the fintech company’s growth — the company claims 34% month-over-month growth in customers for the last year, and says its revenues have increased ten-fold over the same period.

                              <span>Bootstrapped companies don’t come up in startup news as often as those backed by venture capital, as the former don’t have shiny funding rounds to flaunt. Fleet is a good example of a company that has never raised outside capital but has been growing steadily.
The Paris-based company originally offered a way to rent hardware, so instead of spending a small fortune to acquire a bunch of laptops for their employees, companies could use Fleet to lease devices and pay a monthly fee. The company is now launching several software services on top of its hardware-as-a-service proposition, from device management to cybersecurity and insurance.




As a bootstrapped company, Fleet focused on optimizing its operations to remain as lean as possible and spend less money than it earns. For instance, the…</span>

They realized that their former employers at Careem and Kitopi as well as other local businesses in the region struggled with payroll management and high compliance costs due to human error.
Cercli, the startup they launched in January, addresses this challenge via software it developed that allows businesses in the MENA region to hire, manage and pay their global workforce. The potential of Cercli’s platform has attracted investor interest, leading to $4 million in seed funding led by San Francisco-based Afore Capital, marking the fund’s first deal in the region.

                              <span>Hospitals around the world regularly face bed shortages — an issue that can get exacerbated to breaking point when a health scare or other large-scale disaster occurs. A startup called Doccla is bringing technology to bear address the issue: it’s building “virtual bed” tech to help doctors remotely manage patients who have either been discharged early, or in some cases never go to the hospital at all. After gaining traction in the U.K. and Ireland, it’s now raised £35 million ($46 million) to expand in Europe.  
Lakestar is leading the Series B round; Elaia and several existing investors are also participating. The funding comes two years after Doccla raised a $17 million Series A.

When he was head of product at Zynga, he experienced the height of mobile games, working on hits like Words with Friends; then as a vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, he helped produce tentpole hits like Diablo Immortal. And then, as a director of product management at Meta, he learned to see games in new dimensions while working on the VR game, Horizon Worlds. 
“I had to forget what I thought were universal truths and learn a whole new set of ways to do things,” Lu told TechCrunch.




Now Lu wants a front row seat to where video games are heading. After joining the firm as an investor in 2022, Lu helped launch the firm’s Speedrun accelerator, which invests $750,000 ap…</span>

                              <span>A controversial California bill to prevent AI disasters, SB 1047, has passed final votes in the state’s Senate and now proceeds to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk. He must weigh the most extreme theoretical risks of AI systems — including their potential role in human deaths — against potentially thwarting California’s AI boom. He has until September 30 to sign SB 1047 into law, or veto it altogether.
Introduced by state senator Scott Wiener, SB 1047 aims to prevent the possibility of very large AI models creating catastrophic events, such as loss of life or cyberattacks costing more than $500 million in damages.




To be clear, very few AI models exist today that are large enough to be covered by the bill, and AI has never been used for a cyberattack of this scale. But the bill concerns the…</span>

                              <span>When the now infamous CrowdStrike software update took down companies all over the world in July, it was inevitable that lawsuits would follow — and follow they have. Delta suing the company for as much as $500 million in damages and hiring lawyer David Boies is perhaps the highest-profile example.
Among Boies’ wide range of high-profile clients are Theranos, Harvey Weinstein, victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Al Gore in Bush v. Gore around the results of the 2000 presidential election. He also led the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s.




Even before Delta came forward, shareholders were looking for their pound of flesh, filing a class action lawsuit against CrowdStrike alleging that the company had misled them regarding its software update procedures.

The best case scenario is a return of “anywhere between 55% and 57% of the funds,” Gwee told journalists. Under a restructuring, WazirX’s priority will be to distribute remaining token assets to users in a pro-rata manner via crypto, it said.

Validus will use the proceeds to support the financial inclusion of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, addressing the challenges they face in accessing financial resources.




With 64.2 million MSMEs contributing 61% of Indonesia’s GDP, according to Indonesia’s Ministry for Economic Affairs, the potential for growth is immense. These MSMEs employ about 119.6 million people, which is 97% of the total workforce in the country. However, only about 17.5 million MSME players are tapping into the online ecosystem and e-commerce.

                              <span>The Mac mini will be the next Apple device to say goodbye to USB-A, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.
Apple customers have probably gotten used to seeing the familiar, rectangular USB-A ports replaced with their thinner USB-C siblings. And while USB-C has its advantages, the transition can sometimes leave users confused and scrambling for adapters.
The Mac mini, meanwhile, hasn’t been significantly redesigned since 2010, but Gurman says that’s changing this fall. The updated models will include Apple’s new M4 chip, as well as five USB-C ports, plus an Ethernet port, an HDMI connector, and a headphone jack. But the USB-A ports will be gone.
Apple has a “Glowtime” press event scheduled for September 9, where the company is expected to announce the new iPhone 16. The new Mac lineup may not be announced until later in the fall.</span>

                              <span>No matter who powerful generative AI becomes, writer Ted Chiang says it will never create true art.
Chiang is one of the most admired science fiction authors writing today, best known for the novella “Story Of Your Life” (which was adapted into the movie “Arrival”). But he’s also published terrific pieces for The New Yorker looking at the dangers and shortcomings of AI.




You should really read his latest article in its entirety, but briefly: Chiang argues that the potential of large language models remains “largely theoretical” — thus far, generative AI has been most successful at “lowering our expectations, both of the things we read and of ourselves when we write anything for others to read. It is a fundamentally dehumanizing technology because it treats us as less than what we are: creators and apprehenders of meaning.”
Even as LLMs improve, Chiang argues that their output will never be art — which he acknowledges is “notoriously hard to define,” but he tries anyway: “Art is something that results from making a lot of choices.” Sure, those choices might not result in a particularly good novel or painting or film, but you’re still “engaged in an act of communication between you and your audience.”
“We are all products of what has come before us, but it’s by living our lives in interaction with others that we bring meaning into the world,” Chiang concludes. “That is something that an auto-complete algorithm can never do, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”</span>

                              <span>On August 5, Palantir’s CTO Shyam Sankar stood in front of about 20 nervous new employees at the company’s Washington, D.C. office and gave a speech you’d expect at a new hire meeting: company mission, Palantir’s history, etc. But there was one part that would’ve seemed unfathomable a few years ago: Sankar evangelized the importance of a new wave of defense tech startups, spun up by Palantir, Tesla and SpaceX alums.
The significance was more ideological than financial. Any business Palantir gets from startups is dwarfed by its government contracts, after all. But you can’t put a price on philosophical bedfellows. 




Palantir likes to remind the world that it’s not like other publicly traded companies; i.e. buttoned-up and appropriately distanced from its cowboy private days. Sankar ends …</span>

                              <span>As businesses experiment with embedding AI everywhere, one unexpected trend is companies turning to AI to help its many newfound bots better understand human emotion. 
It’s an area called “emotion AI,” according to PitchBook’s new Enterprise Saas Emerging Tech Research report that predicts this tech is on the rise. 




The reasoning goes something like this: If businesses deploy AI assistants to execs and employees, make AI chatbots be front-line salespeople and customer service reps, how can an AI perform well if it doesn’t understand the difference between an angry “What do you mean by that?” and a confused “What do you mean by that?”

                              <span>“The Jetsons” debuted September 23, 1962. The first episode, titled “Rosey the Robot,” was an origin story of sorts for the titular character, describing how an overworked Jane hired the housekeeper. Sixty-two years after her debut, Rosey remains an important pop cultural touchstone for the unfulfilled promise of home robots.
The home of 2024 isn’t necessarily wholly devoid of robots. According to its own figures, iRobot has sold more than 50 million Roombas. That, meanwhile, is a fraction of the overall number of robot vacuums that have been sold around the globe. Robot lawnmowers and pool cleaners have gained traction as well, though those figures pale in comparison to their vacuuming counterparts.

                              <span>Startups globally have faced challenges over the last couple of years when trying to exit, due to factors like a frozen IPO market and reduced attractiveness to buyers. In addition, large mergers-and-acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly involving Big Tech or multi-billion-dollar conglomerates.
Notably, a decline in venture investment within any startup ecosystem can often be linked to a lack of exit volume and value. In Africa, for instance, the number of M&amp;A exits peaked at 44 in 2021, when the continent attracted nearly $6 billion in venture capital. However, in 2022, the number of exits dropped to 29, alongside a decrease in venture capital investment to over $3 billion.

“We believe there was some internal miscommunication at Silverbear Capital, one of our lead investors, which has caused unnecessary confusion,” CEO Justin Grooms wrote in an email reportedly viewed by Forbes. “The fact is, they signed a binding term sheet committing $200 million. Our exceptional legal team at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher stands ready to represent the company in seeking to enforce our rights vigorously.”

                              <span>A Brazilian court’s decision to ban X (formerly Twitter) seems to be benefiting its rivals, especially Bluesky.
The microblogging platform announced late Friday that it was seeing “all-time-highs for activity” with 500,000 new users joining in the previous two days. It’s also number one on the free iPhone app chart in Brazil today, ranking just ahead of Meta’s Threads at number two.




Noting the rankings, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber wrote, “good job Brazil, you made the right choice.”
That growth is particularly impressive for a platform that only fully opened to the public in February and winkingly acknowledged its small size (especially compared to rivals X and Threads) by describing itself as “the short king of social apps.” The company says it had more than 6 million users as of May 2024.
Bluesky was first announced in 2019 as a Twitter-backed initiative to build an open, decentralized social protocol. It has since become an independent public benefit corporation, with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey leaving the board earlier this year.
Elon Musk’s X, meanwhile, has been engaged in an escalating legal fight with Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over the company’s refusal to block certain accounts as part of a broader crackdown on what Moraes said is election disinformation. 
X said earlier this month that it would shut down operations in Brazil, with Moraes then warning the company that it would be banned if it did not name a legal representative in the country. He followed through on Friday, and also threatened fines against users who try to circumvent the ban by using a VPN.
As the ban approached, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva seemingly bid farewell to his X followers by linking to his other social media accounts — starting with Bluesky.</span>

                              <span>Amazon announced Friday evening that it has hired Covariant’s founders — Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan — along with “about a quarter” of the startup’s employees. It’s also signed a non-exclusive license to use Covariant’s robotic foundation models.
Earlier this year, Chen told TechCrunch that Covariant is building “a large language model, but for robot language.” In other words, it’s creating AI models for robots, with an initial focus on robotic arms performing common warehouse tasks like bin picking.




“With some of the smartest minds, we will advance fundamental research, marrying our rich expertise to unlock new ways for AI and robots to assist our operations employees,” said Joseph Quinlivan, Vice President of Amazon Fulfillment Technologies &amp; Robotics, in a statement. “[Embedding] Covariant’s AI technology into our existing robot fleet will make them more performant and create real world value for our customers.”
The deal sounds similar to Amazon’s hiring of the founders of AI startup Adept back in June — another deal that gave Amazon access to new talent and technology without having to fully acquire an existing startup.
At the time, The Verge described this approach as a “reverse acquihire,” where tech giants facing antitrust scrutiny can use hiring and licensing deals to disguise their acquisitions, rather than the other way around. 
Covariant, meanwhile, said it will continue operating under the leadership of Ted Stinson and Tianhao Zhang, with Stinson — who’d been the startup’s COO — now stepping into the CEO role. The company added that it remains “dedicated to delivering the Covariant Brain into production environments across a broad set of global industries, including apparel, health and beauty, grocery, and pharmaceuticals.”</span>

He announced that the organization’s prestigious Grammy Awards would finally accept music made with artificial intelligence. At first, people were confused, and then Mason came out to clarify that he meant only humans can submit to the awards, but that AI can be used in the creative process. 




“It’s a bit of a fine line, but that’s going to evolve,” he told TechCrunch about how the Academy is assessing the use of artificial intelligence in music. “My hope is that we can continue to celebrate human creativity at the highest level.” 
The rise of AI has consumed the arts, just as it has Silicon Valley. Everyone is pondering: Will AI replace me? And within music — what happens to copyright? Royalties? To the ha…</span>

                              <span>While searching for mini PCs for my home server, I figured I&#x27;d use the eBay API to find the cheapest ones. Inspired by diskprices.com, I built a static site using Eleventy and a python script that uses regex to parse the data. I tried to include as many filters as possible like OS, Wifi, HDMI etc.
I would like to add power usage, noise levels, PCIe slots but that data is hard to find.
Please let me know if you have any feedback / suggestions.
Thanks!

                              <span>Two decades ago, I posted that I found that the strangler fig plant was an interesting metaphor for the gradual replacement of a legacy system. I didn’t refer to the metaphor since, but meanwhile it grew a life of its own. Other people increasingly referred to the strangler fig approach to modernization, and traffic to that post steadily increased: currently it gets about 5000 page views a month, one of the more popular pages on this site. So I decided I needed to update that page, and have rewritten it, focusing on the core activities we need to do to make a success of such a venture.
