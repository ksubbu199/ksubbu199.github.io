                              <span>Google co-founder and ex-Alphabet president Sergey Brin said he’s back working at Google “pretty much every day” because he hasn’t seen anything as exciting as the recent progress in AI — and doesn’t want to miss out.
Brin revealed the tidbit in an interview during the All-In Summit in L.A. this week. Last year, several publications reported that Brin was back at Google HQ working on various AI projects, but the sit-down is the first time Brin has publicly commented on his return.




“It’s a big, fast-moving field,” Brin said of AI, adding that there is “tremendous value to humanity,” before explaining why he doesn’t think training more capable AI will require massively scaling up compute.
“I’ve read some articles that extrapolate [compute] … and I don’t know if I’m quite a believer,” he said, “partly because the algorithmic improvements that have come over the last few years maybe are actually even outpacing the increased compute that’s being put into these models.”</span>

                              <span>Beats’ expansion into iPhone 16 cases is surprising, if not entirely unexpected. After all, Apple acquired the headphone maker 10 years ago last May. The deal was — as many expected — largely centered around the transformation of the Beats Music streaming service into an Apple-branded offering. Beyond that, however, Apple seems have mostly let Beats keep doing its own thing.
The $49 cases work with MagSafe and the iPhone’s new Camera Control button. They’re made from polycarbonate and have soft fiber interiors. They arrive in the wake of the quiet disappearance of the FineWoven line and appear to be something of a direct replacement for those easily scratched cases. Beats notes that the new cases are “treated with a glossy scratch-resistant coating for extra protection,” so they hopefully won’t suffer the same fate.</span>

                              <span>A group of Democratic senators is urging the FTC and Justice Department to investigate whether AI tools that summarize and regurgitate online content like news and recipes may amount to anti-competitive practices.
In a letter to the agencies, the senators, led by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), explained their position that the latest AI features are hitting creators and publishers while they’re down.




As journalistic outlets experience unprecedented consolidation and layoffs, “dominant online platforms, such as Google and Meta, generate billions of dollars per year in advertising revenue from news and other original content created by others. New generative AI features threaten to exacerbate these problems.”

Therapy, education, and lifestyle changes are usually also advised, but those avenues can prove difficult as well.
Sydney-based Neurode has come up with a novel way to offer some relief to people with ADHD: a wearable headband that can track and treat ADHD symptoms. And you only have to wear it for 20 minutes a day.




The headband uses light electrical stimulation in the prefrontal cortex — some people feel a tingling sensation while other don’t feel anything — to balance the brain. This type of stimulation helps treat ADHD symptoms like…</span>

Orbital launch is a tightly regulated industry governed chiefly by the Federal Aviation Administration, though to obtain a launch license from the FAA, companies must also show they are in compliance with local and environmental law. Rockets that operate commercial services regularly, like SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, do so under a blanket vehicle operator license.

                              <span>Is the grass greener on the other side? We’re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It’s been almost two years since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, now X, leading people to set up shop on alternative platforms. Mastodon, Post, Pebble (which has already shuttered operations) and Spill have been presented as potential replacements, but few aside from Meta’s Threads have achieved the speed of growth Bluesky has reached.
After being invite-only for almost a year, Bluesky became open to anyone in February 2024 and gained almost 800,000 new users in a day. As of September 2024, Bluesky has over 9 million users, thanks to an influx of users after X was banned in Brazil. While the number is promising, the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete with Threads’ 130 million monthly ac…</span>

                              <span>For all of the new health features Apple talked up at Monday’s iPhone 16 event, a familiar one was M.I.A. The blood oxygen feature, introduced with the Series 6 device, will not be present on Series 10 models sold in the U.S. The rest of the world will be able to access the tech on the new watch.
The loss of a major feature like blood oxygen must sting, as the company has made health features foundational to its wearable. The feature’s exclusion is a product of Apple’s ongoing patent battle with medical device company Masimo. The dispute forced Apple to disable the feature on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 late last year.




Apple has not discussed whether the feature’s removal was a hardware change on the Series 10 or if it was simply disabled via the software, like with the Series 9. We’ll know more after the smartwatch goes on sale and the teardown experts do their thing. If it’s a hardware fix, then Apple would have had to design slightly different models for each market.
Apple has been fighting Masimo’s suit from the beginning. After the important ban was reinstated in January following a brief pause, Apple worked to enact a similar ban on Masimo’s Freedom health watch.
Monday’s event did find Apple announcing new Series 10 health features that will be available globally, including sleep apnea detection.</span>

Drybaby is also embracing the growing trend of in-person dating experiences, trying to foster a sense of community through alcohol-free socializing. Its main feature is the community section, a hub for users to connect and share events.

Gemini Ultra
Gemini Pro
Gemini Flash, a speedier, “distilled” version of Pro

                              <span>The cyberattack hitting Transport for London (TfL), the government body that runs the U.K. capital’s transit system, is now dragging into its second week. Although the transit system remains operational and unaffected by the cyber incident, some TfL online and digital customer services remain offline.
In a brief update on its cyber incident page, TfL said it continues to deal with an “ongoing” incident. The update removed a line that previously said, “there is no evidence that any customer data has been compromised,” and replaced with, “the security of our systems and customer data is very important to us.” 
TechCrunch asked TfL on Friday if the organization has the technical means, such as logs, to determine what, if any, customer or employee data was exfiltrated from its systems. A spokesperson declined to answer at the time, and had no immediate comment about the update when contacted by TechCrunch on Tuesday.</span>

The test shares key similarities with its clinical predecessors, prompting people to tap the display when they first hear gradually rising tones of different frequencies.
Hearing Test will be built into iOS 18, though Apple is currently awaiting FDA approval for both it and the newly announced hearing aid feature before launch. There’s seemingly a chance that such approval could come through prior to iOS 18’s general availability on September 16, but there’s currently no guarantee.

But though it has filed off some of the sharper edges of the controversial technology, the company seems to have hit the same wall as everyone else: Apple Intelligence, like other AIs, doesn’t really do anything.
Well, it does do something. A few things, in fact. But like other AI tools, it seems to be an incredibly computationally demanding shortcut for ordinary tasks. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially as inference — that is, performing the actual text analysis, generation, etc. — becomes efficient enough to move to the device itself.

                              <span>Huawei on Tuesday launched the Mate XT Ultimate Design, which is a long name for a big phone. The handset ups the ante for foldables in terms of both displays and pricing. The device starts at CNY 19,999 (roughly $2,800). Paying about a grand north of your standard foldable price gets you a unique three-screen design, bringing a 10.2-inch main display to your pocket.
Presently, the Mate XT Ultimate Design is only available in Huawei’s native China. It likely won’t have much presence outside of that market and almost certainly will never come to the States, given the ongoing ban that kneecapped the initial Mate X.</span>

Apple Intelligence was the star of the Apple event this year, like it was at WWDC in June, and Apple’s lineup of announcements echoed many of the anticipated hardware reveals, including the new iPhone 16, AirPods 4, the Apple Watch Series 10 and more. Broadcasting live from its headquarters in Cupertino, Apple’s “Glowtime” event kicked off at 10 a.m. PT, and you can watch the recording of the full Apple event here. 
Whether Monday’s reveals end up inspiring or delaying a “supercycle” of customers adopting the new iPhone 16 lineup remains to be seen, but Apple’s focus on AI as a core part of its sales pitch moving forward is clear. We’ll keep this post updated as rep…</span>

                              <span>It’s not every day that you hear about a large funding round for a French startup in the current funding environment. But Neat, a Paris-based insurtech startup, has managed to raise €50 million (around $55 million at current exchange rates).
There is some fine print however. In addition to the traditional equity-for-cash financial transaction, a portion of this funding round is a debt facility. It’s around 60% in equity and 40% in debt, according to the company. So it’s more like a €30 million round with €20 million in debt on top of that.




Neat helps other companies sell insurance products to their own customers. In insurance lingo, it focuses on affinity insurance contracts linked to another service or product.

The startup launched an aftermarket warranty product for Tesla vehicles called AmberCare — which is a suite of warranty plans that cover various parts of the electric drivetrain, as well as service at authorized shops — in 10 states back in March. That is now expanding to 47 states thanks to a new partnership with Lexington National Insurance Company.

The Polaris Dawn mission lifted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at 5:23 AM EST after several delays due to inclement weather. Near the end of the first day of the mission, the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule’s orbit will reach a high point of 1,400 kilometers (870 miles). This will be the highest altitude humans have traveled since the Apollo 17 mission to the Moon in 1972, and three times higher than the International Space Station.

                              <span>Amazon has announced a new pilot package delivery service in Frankfurt, Germany, that meshes electric road and rail transport.
The e-commerce giant will use vans from its delivery depot to the first tram stop on the outskirts of Frankfurt, with the city’s new Gütertram service transporting the goods to awaiting cargo bikes. Gütertram constitutes part of a research project from Frankfurt University and the local municipality and fits with a broader Amazon initiative to embrace trains. In April, the company signed a logistics contract to use a rail network to transport goods between fulfilment centers in Germany and Italy.
Amazon has been pushing its green credentials to counter various damning environmental reports through the years, though last year it abandoned plans to make half of its shipments carbon neutral by 2030. 
This isn’t the first time trams have been repurposed for cargo in Europe. In Germany, Dresden operated the CarGoTram for two decades until its recent closure, while Deutsche Post DHL piloted something similar in Schwerin, scrapping it less than two years after its 2022 launch.</span>

Already, Apple pays Alphabet roughly $20 billion per year to make Google the default search engine in its Safari browser. Now, iPhone 16 users will be able to access Google’s search engine — and its visual search capabilities — with a click of the device’s new Camera Control button.

This additional funding is much smaller than Spotter’s most recent raise, a $200 million Series D round led by SoftBank in 2022. Spotter, then valued at $1.7 billion, raised that funding to underwrite YouTubers’ businesses.

                              <span>Cities spend hundreds of millions each year on paratransit services, or public rides for disabled residents, yet those services remain limited and unpredictable. Wheelchair users often face late pickups, hindering them from getting to work or medical appointments on time. As populations age, the strain on these services and city budgets continues to grow. 
Vancouver-based startup Spare says it can apply modern technology to improve cities’ paratransit systems and bring more on-demand services to the mix. Its software-as-a-service platform integrates different types of local transportation services — including wheelchair-accessible paratransit services, local on-demand microtransit operators, and even ride-hail like Uber and Lyft — to match riders with the right service and vehicle operator…</span>

Lucid announced the news ahead of a planned “Technology and Manufacturing Day” event at its Arizona factory, where the company will go into greater detail about how it has designed and will build the Gravity. The company previously announced that it would start offering adapters for its current EV, the Air, in 2025 and that it planned to integrate NACS charging in future vehicles.

                              <span>Can AI ever fully replace translators? Not likely. AI translations tend to lack the lexical richness of their human-translated counterparts, mainly because AI models make choices based on probability — not lived experience. Certainly, AI can produce “accurate” translations, but the translations lack the spice of life, like a textbook version of the source text.
For many companies, accuracy is all that’s required, making the AI translation sector an attractive one. Smartcat, founded in 2016, is among the vendors providing automated translation tools geared toward enterprises, and its co-founder and CEO, Ivan Smolnikov, says business is good.




“We have over 1,000 corporate customers, including 20% of the Fortune 500,” he told TechCrunch. “While most of Smartcat’s clients are large global …</span>

Today, Form3 — one of the startups building pipes to do just that by connecting financial players to each other with microservices and APIs to enable account payments — announced $60 million in funding to continue expanding its business. 
British Patient Capital is making the investment, which closes out Form3’s Series C at $220 million. Others in the round include a mix of notable strategic and financial investors such as Visa, Goldman Sachs, MasterCard, Barclays, Molten Ventures and 83North.

However, the company might make it easier to send messages to Instagram right from the Threads app.
App researcher Adwaith Varma posted on Threads an unreleased Threads feature, highlighting a new messaging button on users’ profiles. When tapping that button, users could see a text box and a send button to send a message to someone’s Instagram inbox quickly.




Threads confirmed to TechCrunch that this was a public test with a limited set of users, and it is not active anymore. However, this means the company might bring some features to at least initialize messaging directly from Threads.

                              <span>Google has once again lost in its bid to overturn a 2017 antitrust decision by the European Commission. The bloc found its shopping comparison service had broken competition rules — hitting Alphabet, Google’s parent, with an at-the-time record-breaking €2.42 billion penalty (around $2.7 billion at current exchange rates) and ordering changes to how it operates the service.
Google appealed the decision and, in November 2021, the General Court of the European Union largely dismissed the challenge. It confirmed that self-preferencing its own shopping service in general search results was anti-competitive, harming rival shopping comparison services, and upholding the Commission’s penalty. However, the Court did find the Commission had not established that Google’s conduct could have had antico…</span>

The Berlin-based startup’s first products use a base of Koji protein, a type of fungal microorganism that’s been used in Asian cuisine like miso and soy sauce for thousands of years. But while Koji is an ancient ingredient, Formo claims to be the first fermentation startup to be able to use it to make industrial quantities of dairy-free cheese.

                              <span>While living in the U.S., the Trivedi family was looking for a solution to follow a ritual practice of worshiping at one of India’s Jyotirlingas — a holy representation of the Hindu god Shiva. After searching on YouTube for ways to offer flowers and other items ceremonially at the Indian temple one Sunday in 2023, the family found a video about an emerging devotional app called Sri Mandir.
The app offers customized videos of ceremonial prayers from more than 50 Hindu temples in India and allows users to participate in prayers, offer donations, and access devotional content virtually from their iPhone or Android smartphone. That’s exactly what the Trivedi family was looking for.




It’s been about a year, and the Trivedis are still using Sri Mandir. One family member told TechCrunch that t…</span>

                              <span>You could argue whether Cybertruck owners crave attention, but attention they receive, often by critics poking fun at the vehicles. People seem to particularly delight at Cybertruck mishaps, as when one arrived on Nantucket back in May and promptly got stuck in the sand. 
Perhaps it’s little wonder then that a damaged Cybertruck in Seattle’s Central District became its own tourist destination in recent days after being left on the side of a busy street. While it’s not clear how long it was there, it stayed long enough to become a point of fascination for Redditors, one of whom chronicled a makeshift memorial erected in front of the Cybertruck’s front bumper. According to Jalopnik, someone even created a Google Maps pin entry for the car that was later deleted.
Seemingly, the truck was finally removed sometime on Monday, ending the intrigue. Judging by a photo on Reddit, its makeshift memorial was removed, too, with only two squished barrier posts left in its wake.</span>

By analyzing vast amounts of biological data, AI can help researchers predict how different chemical compounds will interact with specific targets in the body, accelerating the discovery of promising drug candidates.
It’s against this backdrop that Cambridge University spinout CardiaTec is striving to tackle cardiovascular diseases (CVD). To bolster its efforts, the company today said it has raised $6.5 million in a seed round of funding.

                              <span>The newspaper business has been in the middle of a long and slow decline thanks to the rise of the internet. Now some new research out of the U.K. lays bare how TV news is facing a similar fate. 
Online platforms have now overtaken TV for the first time as the most popular resource for news among adult consumers, at 71% versus 70%, according to new research from U.K. communications regulator Ofcom.




This is a significant shift. Not only has TV dominated news for more than 60 years (a period when it overtook newspapers in popularity for news; that was the first blow for broadsheets), but also as online platforms replace broadcasters (and newspapers), the news they carry comes from a much wider set of sources.

                              <span>Apple’s watchOS is getting a few AI-powered upgrades, the company revealed at its Apple Event 2024 on Monday. Most were revealed at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, but Apple shed a bit more light during its keynote this morning.
The Translate app is coming to the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11. Like on other platforms, Translate will leverage AI for speech recognition and translation in a range of different languages.




On the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra, Translate can work without a phone connection. Apple says that they’re the only Apple Watch models with enough storage to download the necessary language models; you can download up to 20 models at a time.


AI is also improving Smart Stack, the watchOS feature that uses contextual information to show relevant widgets. Smart Stack will soon automatically add new widgets “when you need them,” Apple says — presumably based on factors like the time of day and your location.
In one last AI-powered enhancement, watchOS 11 has a new “photos” watch face that’ll use machine learning to identify and curate photos from your library.

Story of the week
The Starliner saga has finally come to an end — for now. Just after midnight on Saturday, Boeing’s Starliner capsule returned from the International Space Station, touching down at White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico.




The capsule returned autonomously to Earth without its two crew members, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will remain aboard the station unt…</span>

The company has long taken a “less is more” approach to any detail that might disrupt its devices’ feng shui. The company is feeling a lot more bullish about buttons these days. After introducing the Action Button on the Apple Watch Ultra, the company added the feature to the iPhone 15 last year. With another new iPhone comes another new iPhone button: Camera Control, which was announced at Apple’s “Glowtime” event on Monday.
The feature harkens back to the bygone days of devoted camera buttons, which have almost entirely fallen out of favor on smartphones. For some, the quick, successive addition of two new buttons may feel like a step back.

A select, U.S.-based cohort of audiobook narrators will be invited to train AI on their voices starting this week, Audible said. The trained AI will be used to make recordings, and narrators will have the chance to approve their synthetic voice for specific works as well as edit the pronunciation and pacing. 
Audible says narrators who participate in the program will be compensated for any audiobooks created using their AI voices on a title-by-title, royalty-sharing basis.</span>

                              <span>Last year, Apple couldn’t say enough about the reduced climate impact of its products, going so far as hiring Octavia Spencer to play Mother Earth in a highly produced, five-minute promo spot. This year? Apple spent just a few minutes on the subject, total.
That’s not to say the company is backsliding on its prior commitments — there was nothing in the keynote to suggest that — but it does show just how hard meaningful progress on carbon emissions can be, even for one of the world’s most valuable companies.




The Apple Watch once again led climate news at this year’s event. Previously, only the aluminum and Ultra models were claimed as carbon neutral; this year, the higher end versions, now made with a recycled titanium case instead of stainless steel, qualify.

                              <span>Streaming data and Kafka specialist Confluent on Monday announced that it has acquired WarpStream, a Kafka-compatible streaming data solution. Confluent plans to use WarpStream’s cloud-native solution to fill out its portfolio by offering a new service (Confluent WarpStream) that can sit in between its fully-managed Confluent Cloud and self-managed Confluent Platform.
As Confluent co-founder and CEO Jay Kreps told me, he thinks that what sits in between those two existing models is what he calls the “bring your own cloud” (BYOC) model.




“There’s definitely a set of people who want some self-managed piece of software. They’re going to go around themselves,” he explained. “And there’s a set of people who want a fully managed cloud. But in some of these organizations, there’s a set of use …</span>

                              <span>Apple will sell the just launched iPhone 16 Pro lineup in India at prices approximately 15,000 rupees ($178) lower than its predecessor’s launch prices, as it extends the benefits from reduced import duties and expanding local manufacturing to consumers. The company unveiled the new phones at its Apple Event 2024 on Monday.
The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models now start at 119,900 rupees ($1,428) and 144,900 rupees ($1,725) respectively, compared to their iPhone 15 Pro counterparts which were priced at 134,900 rupees ($1,606) and 159,900 rupees ($1,904) at launch.




This price reduction follows India’s recent decision to lower import duties on electronics and Apple’s expanding local manufacturing operations in the country. In July, Apple had already decreased prices of its pro iPhone 15 models in India by 3% to 4%.
Apple will soon commence sales of India-made iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models in the country, although initially it will rely on imports for the Pro models, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
India has emerged as a key overseas market for Apple. Apple’s revenue from India jumped 42% to $8.7 billion in 2023 from a year earlier, according to Morgan Stanley.
iPhone shipments in India climbed 39% to 9.2 million units in 2023, making it the company’s fifth-largest market for its phones. India’s market for iPhones is larger than any single country in the European Union, Morgan Stanley added.
Apple’s share of the country’s smartphone market is also surging as the domestic economy improves. The company’s market share had reached double digits in Q4 last year, though the share has fallen in the quarters since, according to UBS.</span>

As previously announced at WWDC 2024, iOS 18 introduces a host of new features. Among the highlights are a set of customization options, such as being able to arrange apps and widgets on the Home Screen and customize buttons. Other features include new text effects, the ability to lock and hide apps, new ways to manage your Mail inbox, the introduction of iMessages over satellite, a significant redesign of the Photos app and more.




For now, you can test the updates through the iOS 18 public beta, though you should keep all the caveats that come with beta software in mind.

                              <span>After months of speculation, Apple Intelligence took center stage at WWDC 2024 in June. The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.
Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category.

                              <span>For some, AI fatigue is real — but clearly venture investors haven’t grown tired of the category.
In the first half of 2024 alone, more than $35.5 billion was invested into AI startups globally, recent Crunchbase data found. Five of the six venture rounds of more than $1 billion raised in the first half of 2024 were raised by AI companies. Since the end of June, another 10 mega-round deals have occurred, with these companies raising over $3 billion; $1 billion of that total went to one company, the new one launched by OpenAI’s co-founder Ilya Sutskever.




Here are the U.S.-based AI companies that raised $100 million or more so far in 2024.

                              <span>Apple Intelligence might be the new hotshot in town, but iOS 18 is offering many features beyond that. The company announced Monday at its iPhone 16 “Glowtime” event that the new software update for iPhones will arrive on September 16.
iOS has some notable aesthetic updates, including the ability to place icons anywhere on the home screens and leave blank spaces. Plus, you can change the color of icons and even make them larger. Using Siri will now light up the edges of the iPhone instead of appearing as a glowing orb at the bottom. 




What’s more, the control center now has a multi-page layout with the ability to customize and add controls with support for third-party apps. You can also swap out the default flashlight and camera icons on the lock screen.
The update brings a dedicated passwords app and a redesigned Photos app. The new Photos app does away with the bottom bar and different tabs and adopts a single-page view. The app will surface old photos regularly through different carousels.
In terms of language-related updates, multilingual and multiscript keyboard, support for Hindi in the translate app, and support for Arabic in Live Text.
The call app gets a massive update that lets you search through call history and contacts. In Messages app, now you can schedule messages for later.
You will get the iOS 18 update if you have an iPhone XR or later, or iPhone SE (second gen) or later. Here is the full list of devices with iOS 18 support.
We will have a longer story about iOS 18 update and what you get out of it later this month.</span>

                              <span>Apple will release macOS Sequoia on September 16, its earliest major desktop operating system launch ever, as the company leans heavily on AI features to drive a new wave of hardware upgrades.
The new OS, first unveiled at WWDC 2024, introduces a suite of AI-powered features called Apple Intelligence and crowd-favorite iPhone Mirroring. 




Industry analysts see the rapid release as Apple’s attempt to boost hardware sales. Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring suggests in a recent report that AI features could drive a “multi-year product refresh cycle” for Apple, potentially speeding up device replacement rates.
With macOS Sequoia, users can expect more natural language processing in Siri, intelligent summarization in Notes, and context-aware suggestions across various apps.

When the upgraded Voice Memos app rolls out, you’ll be able to sing over a track you recorded earlier — a guitar track, say — by tapping on a new “layer” button before you hit record.


Voice Memos will play the music track through the iPhone’s speakers while simultaneously recording the second track. When you stop the recording, Voice Memos will use “advanced processing” to isolate the new track and cancel out the background music.</span>

While consumers won’t get the full impact of the Siri upgrade until Apple Intelligence launches, Apple promises it will upend the user experience by making the iPhone not just a small computer that fits in your pocket, but a small personal assistant powered by AI.




In the near term, Siri will see more immediate improvements, including the ability to type questions to Siri instead of speaking, and to engage in more natural conversations — including the occasional stumble — thanks t…</span>

The Camera Control, the new button on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, can launch what Apple calls “visual intelligence” — basically a reverse image search combined with some text recognition.




If you use visual intelligence to search for a restaurant, for example, it’ll pull up restaurant hours, ratings and options to check out the menu or make a reservation, Apple says. Or, if you come across a flier for an event, you can use visual intelligence to quickly add the title, time, date and location to your calendar.
The company says the feature will respect your privacy and Apple services will never store your images.
Through Apple’s partnership with OpenAI, you’ll also be able to use the new Camera Control button on iPhone 16 models to send the query off to ChatGPT instead. Apple suggests the feature could be used when stuck on a homework assignment, as one example.
Visual intelligence will launch along with other Apple Intelligence features in beta in October for U.S. English language users. Users in other countries can expect to get it in December and early 2025.</span>

                              <span>Apple is adding a dedicated touch-sensitive camera button to the iPhone 16 series, the company announced during the “Glowtime” event. The button is covered by a smooth texture sapphire crystal and a stainless steel rim.
Pressing the button for the first time will open the camera app. You press it to take a photo and press and hold to start a video recording. Because the button is touch-sensitive, you can also control zoom by sliding your finger across.




If you press the camera control lightly twice, it brings up other controls, such as depth of field.
In prior iPhone models, you could trigger the camera through the lock screen icon and use the down volume key to capture a photo. On the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max, there is already an option to trigger the camera through the Action Button. This option will be available to all iPhone 16 series models, too.
All these shortcuts could still be useful if people want to map it to different actions. For instance, they could use the action button to take selfies, especially given it is located on the upper left half of the frame.
The company is also allowing third-party apps to take advantage of different press and touch gestures of the camera control. During the event, Apple said that Snapchat is using this button to experiences like quickly sharing a moment with friends. 
Apple said that it will update camera control later this year with a two-state shutter that can lock focus and exposure on the subject. Users can activate this feature by lightly pressing the camera button. 
And since iOS 18 allows users to replace lock screen icons, they can place another camera app instead of the default one on the lock screen.

                              <span>Steve Brotman started Alpha Partners in 2014 with a novel idea at the time: investing alongside early-stage VCs to help preserve their ownership in promising companies as they transition to later funding rounds. Alpha’s first fund was a mere $10 million.
But as startups started staying private for longer, the VC industry invented various mechanisms for maintaining stakes in their best startups. Many early-stage firms raised opportunity funds, which are dedicated pools of capital specifically designed to double down their most promising investments. Others relied on special purpose vehicles (SPV), financial instruments that allow multiple parties to pool their funds to invest in a single company. Alpha Partners’ approach also gained some popularity.

Both models are reportedly getting that sleep apnea feature, though it likely won’t be available at launch.
Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 “It’s Glowtime” event; this much we can tell you for certain.

The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus. But for people who won’t be present in person, they can tune in here or watch the stream on Apple’s website.




We expect to see new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models, as well as updates to the Apple Watch, AirPods and perhaps even new Macs, although those are a big “maybe.”  
Apple unveiled its AI suite, Apple Intelligence, at WWDC 2024 and has rolled out some features to the 15 Pro models through developer betas. These features will make their way to consumers with the public release of iOS 18. Plus, Apple might offer some Apple Intelligence-powered features exclusively for the iPhone 16 lineup.
As always, TechCrunch will be covering the event, bringing you news as it happens.</span>

But a bug in how WhatsApp implements its so-called “View Once” feature in its browser-based web app allows any malicious recipient to display and save the picture and video, which should vanish immediately after being viewed. 




The “View Once” feature is designed to work only on WhatsApp’s mobile apps on Android and iOS. WhatsApp rolled out the feature in 2021. 
In typical circumstances, when a user receives a “View Once” picture or video while using WhatsApp on the desktop app or on the web app, the user will see a warning that the picture or video can only be opened using WhatsApp on their phone.

Israeli developer Eden Federman thinks the solution is distributed tracing, a more advanced observability method, but he found adoption to be lower than he expected due to implementation hurdles. This led him to co-found Odigos, a startup that helps companies easily monitor complex, cloud-native systems that handle large amounts of data, as is now often the case.




He and CEO Ari Recht aren’t related, but their wives are cousins. That’s how Federman ended up asking Recht, an investment banker (standing on the left in the picture above), if he could present him …</span>

                              <span>Car rental giant Avis is notifying hundreds of thousands of people that their personal information and driver’s license numbers were stolen in an August cyberattack.
The New Jersey-headquartered company said in a data breach notice filed with several U.S. attorneys general over the past week that it discovered intruders in one of its business applications on August 5 and took efforts to end the unauthorized access, which the company said began two days earlier. 




Avis did not disclose the nature of the cyberattack and details of the incident remain scarce. An Avis spokesperson did not respond to an email requesting comment about the cyberattack.
In a data breach notice filed late last week with Iowa’s attorney general, the car rental company said that the stolen information includes customer names, mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, their date of birth, credit card numbers and expiration dates, and driver’s license numbers. It’s not yet known why Avis stored this sensitive customer information in a way that allowed it to be compromised.
On Monday, a filing with Maine’s attorney general revealed that Avis’ data breach affects a total of 299,006 individuals to date. A separate filing with Texas’ attorney general reported that Texas had the most number of affected state residents at 34,592 individuals.
Further data breach notices are expected to be filed in the coming weeks with the remaining attorneys general. It’s not yet known if the number of individuals affected by the Avis data breach will rise. 
Avis, which owns the Budget car hire and Zipcar car-sharing brands, has more than 10,000 rental locations in 180 countries, according to the company’s most recent full-year financial earnings reported in February. Avis made $12 billion in revenue during 2023, and the company’s chief executive Joe Ferraro reported $10.2 million in total compensation that year.




It is not clear who at Avis oversees cybersecurity for the company.</span>

                              <span>It’s been an infamous year for software updates gone wrong. But what’s the worst-case scenario for a buggy update? Sonos may be trying to find the answer as its mobile app update continues to derail its best laid plans.
In its most recent earnings call, the company announced that it had no choice but to delay two product releases due to ongoing work on the software front. Now, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that one of these two products is a set-top box that would compete with the Apple TV and other Roku-like devices.
But that’s not all; the company’s reputation has been tarnished, and it’s going to be hard to recover. According to Bloomberg, Sonos’ new Ace headphones are underperforming, and stock is down — even after it conducted a round of layoffs.
The question now is: has Sonos hit rock bottom, or can it spiral down even further?</span>

                              <span>Indian electric scooter manufacturer Ather Energy plans to raise about $370 million in its initial public offering, according to its draft prospectus filed on Monday (PDF), as the startup seeks to capitalize on growing demand for electric vehicles in the world’s third-largest auto market.
The Bengaluru-based startup, which competes with recently listed rival Ola Electric, is targeting a valuation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company said it will sell new shares in the IPO as well as up to 22 million shares from existing investors. 




Ather Energy declined to comment.
The startup said it will use the proceeds to fund a new manufacturing facility in the state of Maharashtra, repay borrowings, and for research and development.

                              <span>Researchers at ETH Zürich are very good at keeping robots standing upright. Back in 2022, the school’s robotics team taught the quadrupedal ANYmal robot how to hike up mountains without falling over. New research from the school, published in collaboration with the Stuttgart-based Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, takes a unique approach to the problem of traversing uneven terrain.
Artificial muscles showcased by the schools are powered by a hybrid electro-hydraulic system. Along with the ability to adjust automatically to the surface they’re traversing, the legs move faster and jump higher than their more standardized electric counterparts, all without requiring additional sensors or controls.




The legs’ actuators are surprisingly simple. The teams describe them as “oil-filled plastic bags, similar to those used to make ice cubes.” Those bags are then covered in electrodes. Honestly, the whole thing sounds a bit like a school science project.





“[A]s soon as we apply a voltage to the electrodes, they are attracted to each other due to static electricity,” says grad student Thomas Buchner. “Similarly, when I rub a balloon against my head, my hair sticks to the balloon due to the same static electricity.”
The bags then expand or contract, based on the voltage being applied. Unlike standard electric actuators, the system doesn’t generate a lot of heat. 
So the actuators help the system traverse uneven terrain and help it jump high. In terms of real-world use, however, the system still has a long way to go.
“Compared to walking robots with electric motors, our system is still limited. The leg is currently attached to a rod, jumps in circles and can’t yet move freely,” says Christoph Keplinger, a professor at Max Planck Institute. “If we combine the robotic leg in a quadruped robot or a humanoid robot with two legs, maybe one day, when it is battery-powered, we can deploy it as a rescue robot.”</span>

The VC has closed new funds totalling $1.24 billion to back early- and growth-stage startups across the region.
London-based Atomico is describing this as its “largest ever fundraise,” although technically it is across two pots of money. “Atomico Venture VI” weighs in at $485 million for mostly Series A-stage companies (with some reserved for seed), and a separate $754 million fund — dubbed “Atomico Growth VI” — is for Series B through pre-IPO.

                              <span>After a rough couple years, YouTube creators The Try Guys said they’re on-track to reach profitability, with subscriptions to their three-month-old, ad-free service 2nd Try now accounting for 20% of the company’s revenue.
Of course, those numbers also mean The Try Guys remain reliant on other revenue streams, including YouTube advertising. But in an interview with CNBC, co-founder Zach Kornfeld said the service is exceeding expectations — and the goal is to keep growing until 2nd Try becomes their biggest source of money.




Beyond their popular videos and series, The Try Guys are also infamous for a scandal in which one of the group’s co-founders was caught having an affair with an employee — a scandal that also damaged the group’s relationship with advertisers.
“Our company was operating at a loss for essentially two years,” Kornfeld said. “We got to a point where it cost more money for us to make the shows our audience loved than we got in from YouTube.”
Another group of popular YouTubers launched a separate subscription service, Watcher Entertainment, earlier this year, provoking fan backlash over a plan to limit the amount of episodes released for free on YouTube.</span>

We’ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow’s “It’s Glowtime” event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it’s believed that Apple Intelligence’s slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential.

                              <span>Elon Musk has denied a report that one of his companies, Tesla, has discussed sharing revenue with another of his companies, xAI, so that it can use the startup’s AI models.
The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterday that under a proposed agreement described to investors, Tesla would use xAI models in its driver-assistance software (known as Full Self-Driving or FSD). The AI startup would also help develop features such as a voice assistant in Tesla vehicles and software for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus.




Writing on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk said he hadn’t read the WSJ story, but he described a post summarizing the report as “not accurate.”
“Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI,” he wrote. “The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.”
Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI (which he co-founded but eventually left). TechCrunch reported earlier this year that as part of the pitch for xAI’s $6 billion funding round, the startup outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X), and its models could then improve technology across those companies.
Tesla shareholders have sued Musk over the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing company.

But parliament remains bitterly divided, generating uncertainty for many economic sectors — including the country’s dynamic startup ecosystem, which had so far benefited from public support.
La French Tech isn’t just a term referring to France’s 25,000 startups; it is also an initiative supported by a public administration, the French Tech Mission, whose director, Clara Chappaz, is departing this month as her three-year contract ends, she told Les Échos. The timing is coincidental, but also noteworthy. Her replacement, she told TechCrunch in late August, should hopefully be someone who is “not afraid of change” and sees it as an opportunity.

                              <span>Italy-based app company Bending Spoons, which owns Evernote and Meetup, is planning to lay off 75% of the staff of file transfer service WeTransfer, TechCrunch has learned. Bending Spoons acquired the Dutch company in July for an undisclosed amount. 
The company confirmed the plans for the WeTransfer layoff to TechCrunch. The staff that is being let go will be informed after Bending Spoons goes through local regulations in different countries regarding lay offs. Dutch media reported that WeTransfer has over 350 employees.




Bending Spoons CEO Luca Ferrari said that typically, the company studies the organization that it is acquiring and determines what is the best vision of the business going forward with an aim to operate it forever.

                              <span>Like every big tech company these days, Meta has its own flagship generative AI model, called Llama. Llama is somewhat unique among major models in that it’s “open,” meaning developers can download and use it however they please (with certain limitations). That’s in contrast to models like Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-4o (which powers ChatGPT) and Google’s Gemini, which can only be accessed via APIs.
In the interest of giving developers choice, however, Meta has also partnered with vendors including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure to make cloud-hosted versions of Llama available. In addition, the company has released tools designed to make it easier to fine-tune and customize the model.

“Do we retire or do we go again?” Bissell told TechCrunch.




Around that time, he was leafing through a science magazine when he stumbled across an article about climate change, which said there could be between a 30 cm to 1 meter rise in sea level before the end of the century. 
“Hang on,” he said to himself. “If that happens, then the living room, the ground floor of this home that we live in, will be underwater twice a day. Then you start thinking about that being in hundreds of millions of other homes around the world. That’s not acceptable.”

“It’s interesting how much a sports team impacts the psyche of a town,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “And if a team ever makes the decision to abandon the town, it creates heartbreak. Fans have described it like a death in the family, and the death is the family member who threw all the parties.”

                              <span>Researchers at ETH Zürich are very good at keeping robots standing upright. Back in 2022, the school’s robotics team taught the quadrupedal ANYmal robot how to hike up mountains without falling over. New research from the school, published in collaboration with the Stuttgart-based Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, takes a unique approach to the problem of traversing uneven terrain.
Artificial muscles showcased by the schools are powered by a hybrid electro-hydraulic system. Along with the ability to adjust automatically to the surface they’re traversing, the legs move faster and jump higher than their more standardized electric counterparts, all without requiring additional sensors or controls.




The legs’ actuators are surprisingly simple. The teams describe them as “oil-filled plastic bags, similar to those used to make ice cubes.” Those bags are then covered in electrodes. Honestly, the whole thing sounds a bit like a school science project.





“[A]s soon as we apply a voltage to the electrodes, they are attracted to each other due to static electricity,” says grad student Thomas Buchner. “Similarly, when I rub a balloon against my head, my hair sticks to the balloon due to the same static electricity.”
The bags then expand or contract, based on the voltage being applied. Unlike standard electric actuators, the system doesn’t generate a lot of heat. 
So the actuators help the system traverse uneven terrain and help it jump high. In terms of real-world use, however, the system still has a long way to go.
“Compared to walking robots with electric motors, our system is still limited. The leg is currently attached to a rod, jumps in circles and can’t yet move freely,” says Christoph Keplinger, a professor at Max Planck Institute. “If we combine the robotic leg in a quadruped robot or a humanoid robot with two legs, maybe one day, when it is battery-powered, we can deploy it as a rescue robot.”</span>

                              <span>A New York Times analysis of more than 3.2 million Telegram messages from 16,000 channels found that the messaging platform has been “inundated” with illegal and extremist activity.
Specifically, The Times found 1,500 channels operated by white supremacists, two dozen channels selling weapons, and at least 22 channels where MDMA, cocaine, heroin and other drugs were advertised for delivery.
The company’s founder and CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France last month, with authorities alleging that Telegram’s lack of content moderation made Durov an accomplice to illegal activity on the platform.
The platform subsequently updated its website to allow abuse reports, and Durov has been posting on his Telegram channel, arguing, “Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach.”</span>

                              <span>Bluesky keeps growing: The company announced that as of Friday morning, it had added 3 million new users, bringing its total user count to more than 9 million.
In other words, the social platform’s user base has grown by around 50 percent in the week or so since a Brazilian court banned X (formerly Twitter). The ban sent Bluesky to the top of the free iPhone app charts in Brazil, where it’s currently ranked number two, behind Meta’s competing app Threads.




In addition to sharing the latest user numbers, Bluesky also assured users old and new that video support is “coming soon.”
The platform started as a Twitter-backed initiative to create an open social protocol, but has since become an independent, venture-backed startup and fully opened to the public in February.
In an earlier post about growth, Bluesky said that 85% of its new users are Brazilian. Bringing on so many new users so quickly has led to occasional technical issues.</span>

On Thursday, an account posting under the name Vittorio wrote on X, “i like White people more, they do more, they are better for the roles i need to climb the kardashev scale i’ll let blacks run and play basketball.”




The account profile included a badge indicating “Vittorio” was affiliated with Warp, whose software focuses on automating state-by-state tax compliance and was part of the winter 2023 cohort at incubator Y Combinator. The badge is something that X (formerly Twitter) created as part of the X for Business program in 2022 and is usually given to employees, but Warp appears to have distributed it more broadly as part of an unconventional marketing s…</span>

The capsule returned autonomously to Earth without its two crew members, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will remain aboard the station until next February. The space agency determined late last month that the pair will make their journey back to Earth onboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, after Starliner experienced technical issues early in the mission. 




At a post-flight press conference on Saturday, NASA’s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich called the flight “darn near flawless.” He added that the successful mission provoked mixed feelings among staff.

                              <span>As a young immigrant in Brooklyn, Mo Shaikh often pondered over his father’s taxi earnings. His father would say he made $100, but Shaikh couldn’t understand why only $60 made it home. (The rest, he learned, went to intermediaries.) This early experience sparked his curiosity about financial systems, but also their shortcomings and the need for change.
Shaikh went on to study finance, economics and psychology at Hunter College, then got an MBA at University of Rochester. After he graduated, he started to cut his teeth in the professional world at places like BlackRock and Boston Consulting Group. But it was his move first to blockchain startup Consensys, and then Meta to work on its cryptocurrency efforts, that he realized that this was the solution to the inefficiencies he’d been witnessi…</span>

In 2024, Washington state terminated cap table software Pulley’s business license, according to state filings.
Carta spokesperson Amanda Taggart told TechCrunch that the company just missed the proper timeline to file its yearly report and pay the corresponding tax. Taggart added that the company has remedied the situation and is waiting on Illinois to return it to good standing. Yin Wu, the founder and CEO of Pulley, said that the company has filed the outstanding returns and is in the process of getting its license reinstated.

Earlier in July, a Ferrari executive was flooded with a barrage of WhatsApp messages that appeared to come from his boss, the carmaker’s CEO, Benedetto Vigna. But the Ferrari executive didn’t recognize the number, and he couldn’t be sure it was really his boss.




Suspicious of the flurry of messages from the unknown number, the Ferrari executive still took a call with the person who claimed to be Vigna. Despite the fact that the purported CEO had Vigna’s southern Italian accent, the executive still felt something was off, so he asked the caller something only Vigna would know, something the two personally discussed days earlier.

The trio came to realize that these artists “made very beautiful things in a very sustainable way,” Nuño recalls, and by the time they were 25, the idea for a business had germinated. They imagined connecting these artists, “their techniques and their stories with the supply chains of global companies looking for more sustainable ways to create products.”

The auditor’s exit comes as Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup with a $22 billion valuation, grapples with a series of crises, including a recent Supreme Court decision to resume insolvency proceedings against the startup.

                              <span>A federal judge says he will deliver a punishment in Google’s antitrust case by August 2025, according to The New York Times, after ruling earlier this month that Google had abused its monopoly power over the search industry.
Judge Amit P. Mehta established a timeline for the remedies phase of Google’s antirust trial during a hearing in Washington, D.C. on Friday, the outcome of which could upend how people find information on the internet. Prosecutors have until the end of the year to submit their proposals, which could take aim at Google’s billion-dollar payments to Apple in exchange for priority placement, or potentially order Google to sell off parts of its business.
A lot can change in one year, however, especially given the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Republican and Democratic donors are both reportedly asking the candidates to shake up America’s tough regulatory environment. The outcome of Google Search’s antitrust case could be on the negotiating table in those discussions.</span>

That growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race.




2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI’s new flagship omni model for ChatGPT. GPT-4o is now the default free model, complete with voice and vision capabilities. But after demoing GPT-4o, OpenAI paused one of its voices, Sky, after …</span>

                              <span>The world will have to wait a little longer to see Blue Origin’s massive New Glenn rocket fly for the first time.
That rocket had been scheduled to launch two spacecraft to Mars for NASA during an eight-day window that opens on October 13. But NASA announced on Friday that it was pushing the mission, called ESCAPADE, to spring 2025, citing potential cost and technical issues with de-fueling the two satellites. New Glenn will now launch some of the company’s own technology in November instead.




The first launch of a new rocket always poses enormous risk, both to the launch vehicle and the payload, and Blue Origin has been racing to get New Glenn ready for launch in a month’s time. Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp acknowledged in a post on X that there was still much to do: “Still lots to do but…</span>

The spacecraft is a “go” for undocking from the International Space Station at 6:04 p.m. EST, though it will be leaving its two-person crew behind, and you can watch the drama unfold live.




Those crew members, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, closed the hatch on Starliner for the final time earlier today. They’ll be monitoring the spacecraft as it makes its way through the atmosphere this evening, before eventually landing in New Mexico shortly after midnight. 
Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft launched to orbit on June 5. This crewed test mission was the critical final step before the company could start providing regular crew transportation services to the space agency, as part of a $4.2 billion contract it won way back in…</span>

                              <span>Some of Vice President Kamala Harris’s wealthier donors are informally asking for FTC Chair Lina Khan to be replaced, reports Bloomberg. It’s not really surprising: her expansive definition of antitrust enforcement has countless industries frantic, and the largest corporations opposed her appointment from the start.
Khan’s FTC, which has opposed mergers that would have been waved through by previous FTC chairs, has seen mixed success. But her nomination by President Biden in 2021 was clearly a challenge to longstanding doctrines that allowed mega-corporations, including “Big Tech,” to consolidate power. She went so far as to call them “mob bosses” in a recent interview with TechCrunch.
The donor pressure may be misplaced, considering that Khan’s term ends later this month. While she will remain in place until the next agency chief is appointed, chances are this will extend her term by months, not years.
Meanwhile, the donors reportedly also expressed a dislike of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whose term ends in June 2026.</span>

Lang said they realized that software providers were trying to build their own booking platforms, à la OpenTable. “We fundamentally didn’t believe this was the right approach for beauty and wellness,” Lang told TechCrunch. The founders envisioned all-in-one software that booked appointments and then automated ongoing text communications that could do everything from appointment reminders to sending care instructions prior to a skincare procedure.

The honors program is one of the first in the U.S. that allows incoming freshmen to apply for the program as part of their initial admission application. It’s a clear indication that robotics is no longer in the realm of hyper-specialized graduate and doctorate programs.
The minor is tied to a handful of other majors, including aerospace engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computational engineering, computer science and mechanical engineering. Each forms a foundational piece of an eventual robotics major. With the rise of robotics in high school STEAM teaching, the program is designed to maintain incoming freshmen’s interest in the growing space.</span>

                              <span>Hydrogen startup C-Zero has raised $5 million of an $18 million funding round, according to an SEC filing.
The company is developing a way to strip hydrogen from methane without emitting carbon dioxide. The resulting hydrogen can be used in a range of industries today, including ammonia and petrochemical production, and potentially others in the near future, including transportation and steel production. The solid carbon waste product has the potential to be reused in everything from asphalt to lithium-ion batteries.




C-Zero raised a $34 million round valued at $124 million post-money in 2022, according to PitchBook data. The smaller target for the new round suggests the company is being realistic about its prospects following its sizable haul during the pandemic.
The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The process C-Zero employs is known as methane pyrolysis. C-Zero’s reactor heats natural gas in the presence of a proprietary catalyst to break hydrogen’s chemical bond with the central carbon atom in a methane molecule. 
By using readily available natural gas as the feedstock, C-Zero hopes to produce emission-free hydrogen for less than other green hydrogen startups, which typically rely on expensive electrolyzers powered by low-cost renewable energy from wind and solar. 
Tapping into existing natural gas infrastructure also makes methane pyrolysis a natural fit for petrochemical plants, which today use natural gas throughout their operations and also require large amounts of hydrogen to produce various chemicals.
The potential to sell low-cost, zero-emission hydrogen to large, established customers has caused a flurry of startup activity in the space, many of which use methane pyrolysis. A number of competing startups, including Modern Hydrogen, Molten Industries and ReCarbon, also use the process.</span>

Most notably, Roblox is adding more ways for creators to earn money through their experiences, and the company is unveiling a project that will power generative AI creation on the platform. 
The company is introducing a new program that will give creators a higher share of revenue for their paid experiences on the desktop. Creators will now receive 50% of the revenue for paid experiences that cost $9.99, 60% for experiences that cost $29.99 and 70% for experiences that cost $49.99. The change marks a significant increase in revenue sharing, as creators currently earn about 25% of the revenue for their paid experiences.

When facing bigger rivals, startups often have to be clever on how to fight. There’s no right answer, which explains why many change their mind along the way when they don’t get a lucky break.

As the league seeks to expand into international markets, the two football teams have traveled to Brazil to make history by playing the first-ever regular season NFL game in South America.
For sports journalists and dedicated football fans who have traveled to São Paulo, the weekend presents an unexpected obstacle: X is now banned in Brazil.

Under the new tie-up, entrepreneurs will pitch their startups to the public through the short-form video app for one of the show’s upcoming episodes. The general public will then be able to vote on their favorite submissions through a landing page in the app followed by a livestreamed pitch review on TikTok. This will all culminate in the selection of four finalists, who will compete on an episode of the show in front of judges in hopes of winning the $1 million investment from Tim Draper.

                              <span>It’s tempting to think the trend of EV startups merging with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to go public has ended, seeing how many of them are struggling or defunct. But that’s not quite true. A startup called Thunder Power Holdings went public on the Nasdaq exchange in June through a SPAC, and is now trying to raise up to $100 million more through a share sale deal. 
All this is happening even as the CEO of the company, Wellen Sham, has been indicted by the Taiwanese government on 11 criminal charges. 




It’s all right there in Thunder Power’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are required for all public companies. Thunder Power spells it out on page 46 of this amended S-4 filing from April, where it explains that the Taipei District Prosecutor’s…</span>

                              <span>Transport for London, the government body overseeing the U.K. capital’s public transit system, said it is experiencing online outages due to an “ongoing cyber security incident” set to drag into the weekend. 
TfL, which runs the London Underground (known as the Tube), buses and trams across London, said that while the city’s public transit system is “operating as usual,” several customer-facing systems are offline, including some ticketing systems and its online real-time Tube arrival information. 




Details of the incident remain scarce. TfL disclosed the cyberattack earlier this week, and said that the government body took action to “prevent further access to its systems.” 
In a brief update on its website on Friday, TfL said it has no evidence yet that any customer data was compromised in the cyberattack. 
A spokesperson for TfL did not respond to a request for comment about what evidence, such as logs, the organization has to determine if any data was stolen. It’s unclear if the organization is able to receive email due to the cyberattack. According to the cyber incident page, TfL says, “many of our staff have limited access to systems and email and, as a result, we may be delayed or unable to respond to your query or any webforms previously submitted.”
According to sources speaking to BBC News, TfL employees have been told to work from home as much of the organization’s back-office systems at its headquarters are affected. 
A review by TechCrunch of TfL’s public-facing web infrastructure shows much of the organization’s systems are no longer online, or have been restricted from accessing the public internet, likely in an effort to isolate the intruders and prevent further access. 




At the time of writing, TechCrunch found several TfL systems, including its employee log-on portal, were still accessible from the internet.</span>

The company is trying to make Instagram more appealing as a messaging app with features to make conversations more engaging. While some of these features might not sound new, it’s all about removing friction for users that might prevent them from sending a message.
In addition, the inbox — or DMs (direct messages) are a competitive feature for social apps, including those that are taking on Twitter/X. While other startups like Bluesky are integrating DMs directly into their app, Instagram’s X rival Threads is still relying on Instagram’s existing DMs for those who want to connect privately.

The Equity podcast crew is wrapping up another eventful week, with real estate, AI agents, gambling, and secondary markets — which are, of course, a form of legalized gambling.
Mary Ann Azevedo, Becca Szkutak, and Devin Coldewey started off this Friday’s episode with the acknowledgment that the X/Twitter ban situation in Brazil is possibly too complicated an issue to even have an opinion on. Let us cook on that for a bit.




In the deals of the week, Devin first talked about You.com’s $50 million play to take on more difficult AI tasks, things that can’t be solved with a quick Google search. The company is hoping to be the go-to for complex stuff that mixes live search, coding, and natural language understanding — and unlike a lot of its…</span>

                              <span>More antitrust woes for Google. The U.K’.s competition watchdog said on Friday that it suspects the company of adtech antitrust abuses. The tech giant will now have a chance to respond to the provisional findings before the regulator reaches a final decision.
Confirmed violations of U.K. competition law can lead to corrective orders and fines of up to 10% of annual worldwide group turnover. So the outcome of this case is likely to be closely watched.




The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating Google’s role in the adtech stack over suspected abuses of dominance since May 2022. The new development is the sending of a formal statement of objections to Google setting out provisional findings that accuse the adtech giant of self-preferencing its own ad exchang…</span>

                              <span>You can build a reminder and task management system for yourself, and use a service that works for your team. But it might not be easy to get your family members or friends to use the same task management app. iOS app Karo (which means “do it” in Hindi) aims to solve the problem even if the other person doesn’t use the app.
This isn’t Mustafa Yusuf‘s first task management product. The India-based developer also develops another to-do app called Tasks, for more complex task management. Yusuf told TechCrunch that he developed Karo because other apps didn’t allow him the flexibility of assigning tasks to people in your address book.

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s received — and will “examine” — a number of complaints that have been filed under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
“The DPC will now examine the extent to which any processing that has taken place complies with the relevant provisions of the GDPR,” the regulator told TechCrunch. “If, further to that examination, it is established that TUIC [Twitter International Unlimited Company, as X’s main Irish subsidiary is still known] has infringed the GDPR…</span>

- The app is a simple desktop application that works on macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
- I developed this app for my own needs. Getting tired of SaaS app subscriptions and privacy concerns.
- For now, the activities are logged manually or imported from a CSV file. No integration with Plaid or other platforms.
- No monetization is planned for now (only a &quot;buy me a coffee&quot; if you use and appreciate the app).

                              <span>I am depressed and burned out for quite some time already, unfortunately my brain still couldn&#x27;t recover from it.
If I summarize the impact of burnout to my brain:
- Before: I could learn things pretty quickly, come up with solutions to the problems, even be able to see common patterns and see bigger underlying problems
- After: can&#x27;t learn, can&#x27;t work, can&#x27;t remember, can&#x27;t see solutions for trivial problems (e.g. if your shirt is wet, you can change it, but I stare at it thinking when it is going to get dried up)
Take care of your mental health

                              <span>Telegram has quietly updated its policy to allow users to report private chats to its moderators following the arrest of founder Pavel Durov in France over “crimes committed by third parties” on the platform. 
The messaging app, which serves nearly 1 billion monthly active users, has long maintained a reputation for minimal supervision of user interactions.




On Thursday night, Telegram began implementing changes to its moderation policy. “All Telegram apps have ‘Report’ buttons that let you flag illegal content for our moderators — in just a few taps,” the company states on its updated frequently-asked-questions page. 
The platform has also provided an email address for automated takedown requests, instructing users to include links to content requiring moderator attention.
It’s unclear how, and whether, this change impacts Telegram’s ability to respond to requests from law enforcement agencies. The company has previously cooperated with court orders to share some information about its users. 
TechCrunch has reached out to Telegram for comment. 
The Dubai-headquartered company has additionally edited its FAQ page, removing two sentences that previously emphasized its privacy stance on private chats. The earlier version had stated: “All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them.”




These policy changes follow Durov’s arrest by French authorities in connection with an investigation into crimes related to child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking, and fraudulent transactions. 




Responding to his arrest, Durov posted on his Telegram channel, criticizing the action: “Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach.” 
He argued that the established practice for countries dissatisfied with an internet service is to initiate legal action against the service itself, rather than its management.</span>

                              <span>SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell made a public plea to one of Brazil’s top judicial figures on Thursday, asking him to “please stop harassing Starlink” amid the ongoing battle in the country against Elon Musk’s social media business X. 
Musk has been engaged in a months-long dispute with the Brazilian courts, who have been waging a war against X for hosting accounts that the courts say spread extremism and misinformation. 




After X refused to comply with court orders last month asking it to remove certain accounts, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered an immediate, country-wide suspension of the platform. That ban, backed by Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was unanimously upheld earlier this week. 
But the feud has been spilling over to Musk’s other businesses…</span>

                              <span>Launching a phone company is a remarkably difficult — some even say foolish — thing to do. OSOM Products, which rose out of the smoldering ashes of Essential in 2020, is closing shop. Android Authority was first to report the news, after gaining access to an internal announcement from CEO Jason Keats.
OSOM always had a difficult road, with plans to launch a privacy-focused handset. And much like Essential before it, the company dealt with its own legal struggles — namely a lawsuit against filed by a former employee alleging financial mismanagement.




For its part, the company did manage to release a mobile device, though not the first-party phone it had announced. Rather the company lent its technology to a Web3 focused devices from Solana.
OSOM did manage to bring a product to market under its own name. The OSOM Privacy Cable is effectively a USB cord whose data transfer can be disabled in situations where “juice jackers” might be present.
“The report in Android Authority is correct, OSOM is sadly shutting down. In May of 2024, having no customers for a mobile phone despite concerted efforts, OSOM at the time decided to pivot to a new project,” CEO Jason Keats said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “OSOM was forced to let go of a number of employees at that time to reduce our burn rate.”
The “new project” would appear to refer to an “AI-powered camera” it planned as a followup to its unreleased smartphone. According to initial reports, Keating had attempted to sell the company off to HP, but was unable to strike a deal. 
“Unfortunately, given the bleak market climate for fundraising for consumer electronics startups, we were unable to raise a new round,” Keats says. “While some maintenance operations to ensure contractual requirements will proceed, OSOM’s general operations will shut down on September 6.”</span>

                              <span>Salesforce has acquired Own Company, a New Jersey-based provider of data management and protection solutions, for $1.9 billion in cash.
Own is Salesforce’s biggest deal since buying Slack for $27.7 billion in 2021. The company reportedly considered — but ultimately decided against — purchasing data management software firm Informatica earlier this year.




In a press release, Salesforce GM Steve Fisher said the acquisition “underscores [Salesforce’s] commitment to providing secure, end-to-end solutions that protect our customers’ most valuable data.”
“Data security has never been more critical, and Own’s proven expertise and products will enhance our ability to offer robust data protection and management solutions to our customers,” Fisher continued.

The DOJ announced the indictment of the five members of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate, also known as GRU, and in particular its hacking Unit 29155. The indictment names Russian GRU colonel and commanding officer of cyber operations, Yuriy Denisov; lieutenants Vladislav Borovkov, Denis Denisenko, Dmitriy Goloshubov and Nikolay Korchagin; and a civilian co-conspirator Amin Sitgal, who was previously indicted for some of the same crimes.

StopNCII’s partners then use that digital fingerprint, or “hash” as it’s technically known, to scrub the image from their platforms.

Vay isn’t traditional a ride-hailing or car sharing startup, nor does it operate a robotaxi service. And yet, when customers in Las Vegas or Berlin open the Vay app and hail a car, it arrives without a human behind the wheel.




The Berlin-based startup, which was founded in 2019 and has raised about $110 million to date, has developed teleoperations technology that allows employees sitting in an office to pilot empty vehicles to customers. Once the Vay vehicle arrives, the customer hops in and takes over manual control of the car. Customers drive themselves to t…</span>

It was an arrangement that basically worked: the company grew to have a 13% share of the country’s total exports, making it the largest sesame seed exporter in the market. Yet despite sending seeds to customers in 40 countries, it’s still firmly a medium-sized enterprise, with last year’s revenues clearing just $83 million. 
And it was facing a problem: when Chandarana thought about how he might expand the operation, his bank-based financial arrangement came up short.

                              <span>Copper is critical to the energy transition away from fossil fuels. The metal is an excellent conductor of electricity, used in everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines. But by the end of the decade, the International Energy Agency expects copper supplies to fall 20% short of demand.
One stealthily operating startup thinks it can narrow the gap by helping miners extract more copper from their mines. To do that, Colorado-based Endolith is turning to microbes.




Today, most copper is recovered using hydrometallurgy, which generally involves pouring acid on piles of rock, which strips out some portion of the copper. Endolith supplements that, adding what are essentially domesticated microbes that can boost the amount of copper that leaches out of the pile.

                              <span>At its best, programming is a creative endeavor, but in this age of shifting everything left, much of a developer’s day is filled with what All Hands AI co-founder and CEO Robert Brennan calls the “toil-oriented task” like writing unit tests, managing dependencies and keeping documentation up to date. AI, on the other hand, may not be creative, but it is pretty good at exactly those routine tasks. 
All Hands AI, which announced a $5 million seed funding round led by Menlo Ventures on Thursday, aims to build model-agnostic open source AI agents that can handle most of this toil and allow developers to focus more of their time on doing what they do best.

                              <span>Software documentation — the resources that explain how software works and how to use it — has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. Once mostly in the form of PDFs and static plaintext, docs today are more interactive and user-friendly than they used to be.
But crafting them is still a time sink. Han Wang and Hahnbee Lee, both devs and entrepreneurs, say that they’ve personally struggled with this.




“In the 2010s, companies like Stripe, Hashicorp, Twilio and a bunch others raised the bar on developer content,” Wang said. “They proved that a truly great developer experience for their content is not just a commodity, but a competitive advantage. Since then, every company has been trying to catch up, but it’s actually quite difficult.”

The idea with a product it unveiled last week, called PhariaAI, is to help other companies or the public sector use AI tools regardless of whether it made the underlying tech. “The world changed,” Andrulis told Bloomberg. “Just having an European LLM is not sufficient as a business model. It doesn’t justify the investment.”
Aleph Alpha raised a $500 million Series B round last November. But with category giants like OpenAI having far beefier war chests to fuel development — and, closer to home, France’s Mistral has also raked in more investor cash — the German startup had its work cut out to stay in the LLM fight.</span>

                              <span>Over the past few months, tech execs like Elon Musk have touted the performance of their company’s AI models on a particular benchmark: Chatbot Arena.
Maintained by a non-profit known as LMSYS, Chatbot Arena has become something of an industry obsession. Posts about updates to its model leaderboards garner hundreds of views and reshares across Reddit and X, and the official LMSYS X account has over 54,000 followers. Millions of people have visited the organization’s website in the last year alone.




Still, there are some lingering questions about Chatbot Arena’s ability to tell us how “good” these models really are.

Before we dive in, let’s take a moment to understand what LMSYS is exactly, and how it became so popular.

In a bid to drive down manufacturing costs and improve the performance of its EVs, Rivian changed 600 parts on its flagship R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck. The company left the exterior mostly untouched and instead reworked the guts, including the electrical architecture and a redesigned software user interface that provides detailed illustration-like graphics using Unreal Engine as well as deeper integration with Apple and Google.

The era of free-riding for online retailers ended in 2018 when South Dakota took Wayfair to court over sales tax collection. The Supreme Court ultimately sided with South Dakota. 




Now, online stores and SaaS companies have to collect sales tax from their customers wherever it’s required, which is not an easy task given that tax laws vary significantly by city, county and state.

The announcement comes as YouTube has faced criticism over the past few years for potentially harming teens and exposing them to content that could encourage eating disorders. 




The type of content that YouTube will limit exposure to includes videos that compare physical features and idealize certain fitness levels, body types and weight. Separately, YouTube will also limit exposure to videos that display “social aggression” in the form of non-contact fights and intimidation.

                              <span>YouTube on Thursday announced a new set of AI detection tools to protect creators, including artists, actors, musicians and athletes from having their likeness, including their face and voice, copied and used in other videos. One key component of the new detection technology involved the expansion of YouTube’s existing Content ID system, which today identifies copyright-protected material. This system will be expanded to include new synthetic-singing identification technology to identify AI content that simulates someone’s singing voice. Other detection technologies will be developed to identify when someone’s face is simulated with AI, the company says. 
Also of note, YouTube is in the early stages of coming up with a solution to address the use of its content to train AI models. This has…</span>

The Council of Europe Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law — as the treaty is formally called — is described by the COE as “the first-ever international legally binding treaty aimed at ensuring that the use of AI systems is fully consistent with human rights, democracy and the rule of law.”

The company just raised a $35 million Series B round that will help it further ramp up industrial production of its sustainable alternatives to microparticles and microcapsules, setting it on the path to profitability by 2026. But co-founder and CEO Jamie Walters says the B Corp is just getting started.
The ‘starter’ problem Calyxia is tackling is staggering at global scale: Microplastics are polluting everything around the world, from soils, rivers and beaches to the icy waters of the Arctic — they’re even getting inside our own bodies and brains.

                              <span>Hiring platform ZipRecruiter is launching a new tool, called ZipIntro, to let employers schedule introductory calls with potential candidates at a set time. The tool will also help recruiters suggest potential candidates using AI.
Employers can input information about the role and select a date and time for introductory calls. After that, ZipIntro matches them with potential candidates using AI and sends them an invitation for the call. The tool takes into account employment, education, skills, certifications, interests, and types of jobs users are looking for while matching.

Employers can review these responses from candidates, further screen candidates, and line up back-to-back calls. ZipRecruiter then allows employers to connect with candidates through one-on-one video calls on the platform.




The company said these intro sessions are typically 30-minute to 1-hour long, with each intro call lasting about five minutes. It noted that while these are initial screening calls, some organizations also use this tool to hire high-volume roles that may require fewer interview stages.

ZipRecruiter noted that with ZipIntro, employers get their first RSVP from candidates within 20 minutes of posting the job requirement. 
“With ZipIntro, recruiters and hiring managers can forge those critical connections faster to assess the true potential of each candidate,” Megan Allen, SVP of product at ZipRecruiter said in a statement. “For job seekers, we’re excited to provide them with the opportunity to speak with an employer faster, allowing them to showcase their true personality, soft skills, and passion.”
The company is not the only platform utilizing AI to make the hiring process easier. Indeed is also using AI to help people write about their job experiences. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has deployed an AI tool to help recruiters write better job descriptions.</span>

                              <span>In 2017, DJI introduced the Spark. With a palm-sized body, gesture control and a sub-$500 price point, the system was firmly targeted at social media. It was, in essence, a selfie-drone.
The little quadcopter built up a fanbase, though apparently not one large enough to justify its own continued existence. DJI quietly discontinued the device in 2019, replacing it with the Mavic Mini, the smallest member of its wildly popular folding consumer drone line.




This week at IFA in Berlin, DJI is once again going small with the new Neo. Like the Spark before it, the drone’s ability to land in the palm of the user’s hand is a major selling point. Among other things, that’s shorthand for Neo’s small footprint: At 135 grams (0.3 pound), DJI says its the “most compact and lightest” drone it has pro…</span>

Her grandfather worked for the Ford glass manufacturing plant, where she says he gave her an appreciation for the complexity of building something. When Ennix moved to Silicon Valley and worked for Uber and later Flexport, her fascination for the industry grew, until she had an idea for how make the supply chains more efficient for small and mid-sized businesses. 




“Most of us don’t think about supply chains on a day-to-day basis, but they truly shape everything from what we can buy, where we can buy it, where we live, at what price, which is obviously very top of mind in this economy,” Ennix told TechCrunch.

Frontier offers internet, phone and TV services — it has also partnered with companies like Google and Amazon over the years to bundle other digital services or find new distribution channels.

                              <span>Over a year ago, former Session M exec Eben Pingree received the news that his mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Two days later, his father-in-law was given the same diagnosis. 
To create lasting memories and help his three young children bond with their grandparents, Pingree — along with his co-founders Mike Gerbush, Ashley Hawking, and Brianne Baker — developed Kinsome, a communication platform designed for kids and grandparents to share daily updates and preserve cherished memories.




The app has been in public beta since last year and officially launched to the public on Thursday, just ahead of Grandparents Day.
Alongside the launch announcement, the company revealed to TechCrunch that it secured $1.2 million in pre-seed funding. It’s backed by an impressive roster of investors,…</span>

This is where German startup Reonic comes in. “We give renewable installers the tools to be extremely efficient, and we do that mainly by providing them with planning and workflow software,” said co-founder Tristan Menzinger (sitting on the right in the picture above).

You may even have seen this parody about “goblin mode.”
The chatter ties to a recent blog post that Y Combinator founder and dispenser of startup wisdom Paul Graham wrote about how founders like Airbnb’s Brian Chesky often ignore conventional wisdom regarding running a company at scale. That conventional wisdom — hire great people and let them do their thing — actually often turns into “hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground,” Graham says.
Of course, he can’t say exactly what founder mode looks like because every founder does it differently, but he hopes that it will someday be as widely taught as manager mode. In the meantime, the hot takes on his hot take continue.


it’s called “founder mode” it’s about how to run your company as a founder and how that often goes against traditional management practices. it’s basically what i already do but paul graham created a cool name for it in his latest essay. you know who paul graham is? y combinator? pic.twitter.com/rMKo9iGk6P

Miami — once a hotspot for crypto, an area of interest for a16z — has struggled to retain venture cash and entrepreneurial talent in recent years, Bloomberg notes, with venture investments dwindling to $400 million in Q2 2024 from $5.5 billion in all of 2022, per Pitchbook.
For a16z, the closure deals a blow to plans it outlined in 2022 to ditch a central HQ for “global outposts” in cities including NYC and Santa Monica. Pitched as an antidote to the remote working arrangements that became commonplace during the pandemic (which a16z co-founders Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen once derided as “not a good life“), the outposts were meant to “build relationships” amid founders and help “develop [a16z’s]” culture.
Evidently, things didn’t go quite as planned in Miami.</span>

The high-stakes mission is now set to officially conclude on Friday, with Starliner making its undocking attempt around 6:04 p.m. EST. Should all go to plan, the spacecraft will land at New Mexico’s White Sands Space Harbor approximately six hours later. 




These final maneuvers will bring to a close a troubled first crewed mission for the Boeing-made Starliner. It was meant to be the final certification mission before the vehicle could enter operation as a regular transporter for astronauts traveling to and from the Internation…</span>

                              <span>Back in my day, Facebook was cool. Gaggles of middle schoolers trolled the local mall, where we would stop into the Apple Store, find an early MacBook Pro, and take dozens of pictures with gaudy Photo Booth filters to post on Facebook. Sometimes, other teens would forget to log out of their accounts, and we would post something like “i just pooped” before signing into our own accounts.
This isn’t the case anymore. In 2014, the Pew Research Center estimated that 71% of U.S. teens used Facebook; as of 2022, that percentage dropped to 32%, then slightly increased to 33% last year. Other studies from Edison Research have shown the same trend. Though Meta is reticent to share much demographic information about its user base, the app’s head, Tom Alison, said that there are 40 million daily activ…</span>

                              <span>Cowboy, the Brussels-based company that has been designing and selling electric bikes that you can see in major cities across Europe, has closed a small, strategic funding round of €5 million (around $5.5 million at current exchange rates). That includes €1 million in debt facilities.
While the amount isn’t as impressive as some of Cowboy’s previous fundraises, the company has been looking for an investor outside of the traditional European VC firms that have already invested in the startup — an investor that could potentially open new doors. As a result, Cypress Capital is leading the round. The Hong Kong-based investment firm has strong ties with Taiwan, which is a key hub for the global bicycle industry.

                              <span>HR and payroll software company Paylocity has agreed to acquire corporate spend startup Airbase for $325 million, the companies announced Wednesday.
The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of Paylocity’s fiscal year, which would be sometime in the next 30 to 60 days. It is being funded by borrowings under Paylocity’s revolving credit facility.




It’s a decent exit for seven-year-old Airbase, which was founded by Thejo Kote in 2017 to provide software to midsized companies seeking to better manage their spending. Its platform included bill payments, corporate cards, and employee reimbursements, among other things.

The lawsuit concerned the Internet Archive’s National Emergency Library, a program it established at the beginning of the pandemic to allow wider access to some 1.3 million e-books. Previously only able to be checked out one at a time, books were later able to be “borrowed” by many people at once.




The publishers, which already had an uneasy relationship with both the Internet Archive and the digital book-lending community in general, sued soon after in June 2020. The publishers contended that going from single-user borrowing to limitless borrowing essentially turned the system from a notional library into …</span>

According to Forbes, Breslow sent an email to shareholders thanking them for signing off on the deal. The problem is that many of those investors, including Montauk Ventures and Ash Pournouri, claim they didn’t sign off on anything. Montauk’s founder, Philip Krim, told Forbes he does not support the financing, and Breslow didn’t have his permission to be included in a list of investors that had approved the deal.
Meanwhile, BlackRock, along with Hedosophia and Untitled Ventures, reportedly applied for a restraining order in an attempt to “halt” Bolt’s Series F round. The trio claimed through an attorney that Bolt was “coercing its investors by forcing them to choose between paying millions of dollars for new stock or losing most of their existing investment.”
Bolt declined TechCrunch’s request for comment.</span>

                              <span>A 23-year-old woman who allegedly killed two men in March while using Ford’s hands-free system, BlueCruise, has been charged with DUI homicide by Pennsylvania State Police. The woman, Dimple Patel, turned herself in on Tuesday.
Patel was also charged with homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, tampering with evidence, careless driving, reckless driving and prohibited text-based communications, according to a report sent by Pennsylvania State Police. Patel was driving on Interstate 95 at around 3:20 am ET when the crash occurred. She was traveling at about 71 miles per hour in her 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E with the BlueCruise hands-free driving feature and Adaptive Cruise Control systems activated at the time of the crash.




The men, identified as Aktilek Baktybekov and Tolobek Esenbekov, had pulled over to the left side of the highway and exited their vehicles. Patel rear-ended one of the cars and killed both of the men.
In a statement, the Pennsylvania State Police urged drivers to always stay alert and limit distractions when driving. 
“No partially automated vehicle technology should ever be left alone to perform the driving tasks that are required to safely navigate the roads of the Commonwealth,” according to the statement sent to TechCrunch. “While the advancements in technology are immense, always strive to maintain proper control of your vehicle. If you are driving hands free, be aware and ready to regain control if the situation warrants your immediate reaction.”
The fatal crash in Pennsylvania — along with another one that happened in Texas in February — is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation. It’s one of a number of ongoing efforts to scrutinize the use of partial automation. But it’s one of the first cases where charges have been brought against the driver, who is supposed to supervise the driver assistance system’s performance and take over if it is about to crash.</span>

                              <span>Nearly two years after the layoffs across X’s trust, safety, and security teams, Elon Musk’s social media company is now trying to hire new employees to help moderate content and secure its platform, according to X’s official job listings. 
In the last month, X posted two dozen job openings evenly split across its safety and cybersecurity teams. 




The jobs on X’s safety team range from director of strategic response on X’s safety team to government affairs managers. On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist. 
These are small numbers compared to the number of staff Musk laid off following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. In April 2023, Musk told the BBC that Twitter, as it wa…</span>

This week in AI, two startups developing tools to generate and suggest code — Magic and Codeium — raised nearly half a billion dollars combined. The rounds were high even by AI sector standards, especially considering that Magic hasn’t launched a product or generated revenue yet.




So why the investor enthusiasm? Well, coding isn’t an easy — or inexpensive — business. And there’s demand from both companies and individual developers for ways to streamline the more arduous processes around it.
According to one survey, the average dev spends close to 20% of their workweek maintaining existing code rather than writing anything new. In a separate study, companies said that…</span>

                              <span>The Cosmos Institute, a nonprofit whose founding fellows include Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark and former Defense Department technologist Brendan McCord, has announced a venture program and research initiatives to — in the organization’s words — “cultivate a new generation of technologists and entrepreneurs equipped with deep philosophical thinking to navigate the uncharted territory of our AI age.”
In a blog post, McCord, Cosmos’ chair, said that the Institute will found an AI lab at the University of Oxford called the Human-Centered AI Lab, or “HAI Lab” for short. It’ll be led by Oxford philosopher Philipp Koralus — another of the Institute’s founding fellows — and aim to “translate the philosophical principles of human flourishing into open source software and AI systems.”

They’ll also receive email notifications about events, like a new upload or livestream.
The company tells TechCrunch that the act of linking the account won’t influence the YouTube algorithm in terms of what’s shown to the teen, however, as that’s already personalized to the user. Parents also aren’t able to inform YouTube of the child’s real age via the act of account linkin…</span>

                              <span>No one is putting the remote working genie back in the bottle. Which is good news for Oyster, a payroll and HR platform that specializes in distributed workforces – or “global employment” as its marketing paints it. The 2019-founded U.S. startup has just closed a $59 million Series D funding round led by Silver Lake Waterman. 
The new funding, which brings its total raised to date to $286 million, sees its valuation increase slightly – up to $1.2 billion vs the $1B it was valued at back in 2022 (when it raised its $150M Series C). This means Oyster has maintained its market value at a time when many other tech companies have been forced into down-rounds – bucking a painful trend.

This includes new badges to add to their profiles, such as graduation year, major, clubs, and Greek life. Other smaller updates include more simplified enrollment for students and an exclusive Tinder U app icon for iOS users. 
Tinder is also offering U.S. students 50% off any Tinder premium subscription — Plus, Gold, or Platinum — in hopes of gaining more paid users to the platform after losing 400,000 paid users this past quarter.

X agreed to suspend its processing of European users’ data for AI model training in early August after Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) initiated legal action against the Elon Musk-owned company in relation to consentless use of people’s information to train its AI chatbot, Grok.

Now, as it looks to revive its advertising business, its new incarnation X is hoping for a rerun. The company announced a new TV app available “on several app stores” as part of a wider effort to court more advertisers, creators, and partners around a “video-first platform.” 
That pivot into video will also include a new video tab on X itself, it added. The tab has yet to launch. 




Users are noting that a beta of the TV app is already appearing on Amazon Fire TV and Google TV; we’ve been able to confirm we can see the Amazon Fire TV app ourselves. No sign of the app yet on Apple TV, Roku or other TV platforms.

                              <span>It might have been a brat summer, but Apple thinks it’s “glowtime” for its iPhone 16 event. The company announced that it will host the event to unveil new devices on September 9 at 10 a.m. PT.
The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus. But for people who won’t be present in person, they can tune in here or watch the stream on Apple’s website.




We expect to see new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models, as well as updates to the Apple Watch, AirPods and perhaps even new Macs, although those are a big “maybe.”  
Apple unveiled its AI suite, Apple Intelligence, at WWDC 2024 and has rolled out some features to the 15 Pro models through developer betas. These features will make their way to consumers with the public release of iOS 18. Plus, Apple might offer some Apple Intelligence-powered features exclusively for the iPhone 16 lineup.
As always, TechCrunch will be covering the event, bringing you news as it happens.</span>

                              <span>Korea’s Institute of Machinery and Materials this week showcased a robotic wheelchair with large, deformable wheels that can manage rocks, stairs and other obstacles. During normal operation, the wheel maintains a standard rigid circular form. When it encounters an obstacle, however, it becomes compliant, conforming to the object’s height and shape.
The system, which also appeared in Science Robotics, is surrounded by a “smart chain” structure attached to spokes that alter tension when the chain encounters variations in terrain. The team says the project was inspired by the surface tension properties of water droplets. No word on when — or if — such a system might be commercialized.</span>

When Mayfield raised a $955 million fund last year, Chaddha told TechCrunch the firm didn’t need a multibillion-dollar fund because “copying somebody else is strategy for disaster, strategy for failure.”




The firm is again trying to do something that it sees as unique. On Wednesday, Mayfield said it is launching AI Garage, a $100 million initiative for ideation-stage founders interested in building “AI teammate” companies.
AI Garage wants to distinguish itself from accelerators such as YC or pre-seed programs like Sequoia’s Arc or Greylock’s Edge by modeling the effort on its entrepreneur-in-re…</span>

                              <span>Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the AI startup co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised over $1 billion in capital from investors including NFDG (an investment partnership run by Nat Friedman and SSI CEO Daniel Gross), a16z, Sequoia, DST Global and SV Angel.
SSI told Reuters that it plans to use the tranche to acquire computing power and hire researchers and engineers split between Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. As to what exactly they’ll research, SSI isn’t saying quite yet.
Reuters, citing a source familiar, says that the new funding values SSI at $5 billion. 
Prior to SSI, Sutskever headed the now-dismantled Superalignment team at OpenAI, which focused on general AI safety research. Sutskever quietly departed OpenAI months after a highly-publicized fallout between him, several former OpenAI board members and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over what Sutskever has referred to as a “breakdown in communications.”</span>

One of the reasons this industry is so lucrative is because the majority of people who bet on sports lose. A three-year-old San Francisco-based startup called DubClub is trying to change that.
“When betting on sports, you are at a structural disadvantage versus the sportsbooks,” DubClub co-founder and CEO Ryan Gaertner, told TechCrunch. “They have more data than the average person. Those companies make money when people lose.”




DubClub hopes to help amateur betters win more by finding experts that may help them better understand which bets to make. DubClub is a platform where amateur sports betters can subscribe to professiona…</span>

Its fourth fund, which just closed at €200 million, is twice the size of its previous one, and will be deployed into 20 to 25 European startups making renewable energy more mainstream.
SET’s name, pronounced “set,” stands for Sustainable Energy Technologies.

That’s why You.com is betting the company on answering the second type of question.

                              <span>The new Paper Pro tablet from reMarkable moves the company’s vision of combining PC with paper closer to reality, adding color and capability while keeping the philosophy of focus intact.
The Norwegian company has been something of an unlikely success story. In a day and age where more and more functionality is crammed into our devices, reMarkable’s approach of doing a few things well — and largely in black and white — seems almost self-defeating. But despite swimming upstream, the company has prospered, growing and funding itself without resorting to venture capital, something few startups can say.




With the first reMarkable tablet, the company established the philosophy of focusing on one document at a time, reading and writing on the device as if it were a piece of paper. The reMarka…</span>

                              <span>Good news for Microsoft: The U.K.’s antitrust regulator says that the tech titan’s high-profile acquihire of the team behind AI startup Inflection doesn’t cause competition concerns, and thus it won’t be pursuing a full-scale investigation. 
However, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says that the deal — reportedly valued at around $650 million — does fall under its regulatory purview as a “relevant merger situation,” meaning similar deals in the future may still be investigated on competition grounds — even if a full acquisition has not taken place.

                              <span>In the summer of 2023, Lyft was contemplating the sale of its micromobility business after receiving strong interest from prospective buyers. Today, the ride-hail company is doubling down on its docked scooter and bikeshare operations, positioning itself as the ideal partner for cities looking to enhance their urban transportation networks. 
Since acquiring shared bike and station provider PBSC Urban Solutions two years ago, Lyft has invested in building and deploying better quality e-bikes and docked e-scooters, as well as a new type of docking station that is solar-powered, modular and able to charge both bikes and scooters. 




As CEO David Risher reviewed Lyft’s micromobility assets, he asked himself: “Do we sell the whole thing, or do we operate it?”

                              <span>Spotify is launching daylist globally. It’s a personalized playlist that evolves throughout the day depending on your listening habits. This rollout comes after the company introduced it first to English-speaking markets last year. The playlist will be available to both free and premium users.
The company said it is also adding support for 14 additional languages, including Arabic, Catalan, French (Canada), French (France), German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), and Turkish.




Spotify introduced daylist in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Ireland in September 2023. In March 2024, the feature was made available in 65 more countries, and now the company is launching the feature in all the markets where Spotify is available.
Spotify noted that after the expansion in March, 70% of daylist users come back weekly to access the playlist. However, the company didn’t specify how many users overall have used this feature or how much music discovery it is driving.
Users can access daylist in the Spotify app through the “Made for You” section or on the web through this link. The playlist and its title update throughout the day with some goofy ones like “bedroom pop banger early morning” or “90s rave rainforest late night.” At the time of launch, Spotify said that it uses data of “niche music and microgenres” that you listen to at a particular time of the day to suggest tracks and update the daylist. 
Users can also save a particular playlist they like by tapping on the three dot menu, selecting “Add to playlist” option, and tapping on “New Playlist” to save that exact daylist to their library.</span>

                              <span>Cycle Time is a measure of how long it takes to get a new feature in a
  software system from idea to running in production. In Agile circles, we try
  to minimize cycle time. We do this by defining and implementing very small
  features and minimizing delays in the development process. Although the rough
  notion of cycle time, and the importance of reducing it, is common, there is a
  lot of variations on how cycle time is measured.


A key characteristic of agile software development is a shift from a
  Waterfall Process, where work is decomposed based on
  activity (analysis, coding, testing) to an Iterative Process where work is
  based on a subset of functionality (simple pricing, bulk discount,
  valued-customer discount). Doing this generates a feedback loop where we can learn

                              <span>Digital lending platforms have become an easy and swift alternative source of credit for microenterprises and individuals overlooked by traditional banking institutions. These platforms have turned into a lifeline for millions of underbanked and demand will keep growing, pushing the value of the digital lending platform market in the Middle East and Africa to reach $2 billion in the next five years, recording a four-fold growth since 2021.
This is the market opportunity Ghanaian fintech Fido plans to tap as it explores new markets in East and Southern Africa, sustained by fresh $30 million Series B debt-equity funding. The new capital includes a $20 million equity injection from global impact investment manager BlueOrchard and Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO.

According to the British-American global asset firm, which disclosed how it values its shares in the Indian startup in a securities filing, PharmEasy’s implied valuation at the end of June was about $458 million. 




That’s surprising because in April the startup said it had launched a rights issue to raise about $417 million. The rights issue, which allows existing investors to buy new shares in the firm at a much lower valuation, was oversubscribed, PharmEasy co-founder Dharmil Sheth said in a LinkedIn post.

It’s no wonder then, that the two decided to come together as co-CEOs, pairing their financial backgrounds to create a company that, in hindsight, would have made Pannu’s former day job much easier.
“With Treasury teams deciding how the largest corporations move cash around the world, it became obvious that guiding those money flows was worthy of bringing the best talent to re-think how it’s done,” Sobkowski told TechCrunch.

In the U.S., some Canva Teams subscribers on older pricing plans are seeing the sticker price for a five-person plan jump from $119.99 per year to $500 per year (with a 40% discount for the first 12 months). In Australia, meanwhile, the flat $39.99 AUS (about $26) per-month fee for up to five users has been raised to $13.50 AUS for each user. 




On an individual user basis, Canva Teams prices are now $100 per person, or $10 a month per person, with a minimum of three people required for a Teams plan. Those prices were quietly changed earlier this year for new customers, but now the company is changing the price for customers who’d previously paid a lower price.…</span>

                              <span>Sometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 “It’s Glowtime” event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays.
The livestream kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most.

                              <span>Snap is testing a “simplified version of Snapchat,” CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in a letter to employees published on Snap’s website Tuesday. The CEO says the simplified version aims to improve the platform’s accessibility and usability. For those that remember Snapchat’s 2018 redesign, this news may do little to stoke confidence.
Spiegel attempted to rally employee spirits with his letter on Tuesday after a depressing year for the company’s stock price, which has fallen nearly 50% in 2024. 




“Investors are concerned that we aren’t growing faster,” said Spiegel in the letter.
The “simplified” Snapchat may be an attempt to capture older users, who are historically perplexed by the app’s not-so-intuitive design. Snapchat does a lot better at attracting younger audiences, who seem to just get t…</span>

Neko Health was co-founded by Spotify’s Daniel Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne with a mission to improve preventative healthcare with annual full body scans and AI-powered insights that can detect conditions like heart disease and skin cancer. Now, the Swedish company is launching in London, its first city outside of its home market. 




For £299 and an hour of your time, the company runs a series of scans and tests that it says creates “millions” of datapoints that help determine your state of health across a range of cardiovascular, metabolic, and other conditions.

Since 2020, the FTC says, fraud at Bitcoin ATMs has ballooned nearly tenfold, and just in the first half of 2024, consumers have lost more than $66 million to these scams.
Scammers use tactics like fake phone calls, messages and security alerts to convince people that they’re in danger, and that they should deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM to protect it. Then, the scammer may share a QR code to scan at the Bitcoin ATM, which deposits the cash into the scammer’s wallet.</span>

The German automaker announced in January at CES 2024 plans to add an AI-powered chatbot into all Volkswagen models equipped with its IDA voice assistant. But the U.S. was excluded in that initial rollout.




Now, the automaker is making its ChatGPT-integrated Plus Speech voice assistant — which is an AI chatbot based on Cerence’s Chat Pro product and a large language model from OpenAI — available in new U.S. vehicles. The rollout begins September 6 with the 2025 
2025 Jetta and Jetta GLI models, along with 2024 ID.4 vehicles equipped with an 82-kWh battery. Most 2025 models will offer Plus Speech with AI as they enter the market.
Caveat: A subscription required, although the ID.4 and ID Buzz comes with three years of free access.</span>

                              <span>Social networking startup Bluesky continues to benefit from X’s shutdown in Brazil having now added over 2 million new users over the past four days, up from just half a million as of Friday. This rapid growth led some users to encounter the occasional error that would state there were “Not Enough Resources” to handle requests, as Bluesky engineers scrambled to keep the servers stable under the influx of new sign-ups.
As new users downloaded the app, Bluesky jumped to becoming the app to No. 1 in Brazil over the weekend, ahead of Meta’s X competitor, Instagram Threads. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Bluesky’s total downloads soared by 10,584% this weekend compared to last, and its downloads in Brazil were up by a whopping 1,018,952%.

The big story


Flat-fee real estate
There’s a whole lot of fintech in the real estate world. And last week, I got the scoop on a new startup called Landian that emerged from stealth to take advantage of recent rule changes related to real estate commissions. In fact, one of its co-founders is also one of the people who successfully sued the National Association of Realtors (NAR) to help facilitate those changes. Buyers have t…</span>

                              <span>Instagram’s latest feature aims to boost user interaction within Stories. The social media platform now allows followers to comment on each other’s Stories, making the experience more community-focused, akin to livestreaming where users can engage in larger discussions.
A few users have already spotted the feature, including marketing strategist Taylor Loren (@taylor.loren on Threads). Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted a screenshot in the company’s Channel. (See below). 




Instagram notes that users will be able to disable the option to have comments posted on their Stories, if they prefer. 


The new feature seems to have been inspired by user behavior. Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, has previously expressed how the Stories format is one of the app’s most popular features and is more widely used than posting content to the main feed. Private messaging is also highly favored by many users who prefer engaging in closed groups with their friends.
The addition of public comments to Stories is part of Instagram’s ongoing efforts to increase engagement on the platform. Most recently, the company added the ability to add music to profiles. There’s also a new feature called “Reveal” that allows users to hide Stories so that followers can only see them after sending a DM.</span>

This second fund is significant because Gupta expanded it beyond a corporate fund with one main LP – Prudential Financial – into one supported by a number of financial and insurance LPs. Prudential Financial is the lead investor but the fund also includes TIAA, Lincoln Financial, Generali, Nippon Life, Mutual of Omaha and Willis Towers Watson. Prudential was the solo LP in Pruven’s first fund of $300 million.

In a brief filing with government regulators on Tuesday, Halliburton said it was “evaluating the nature and scope of the [stolen] information,” and what data breach notifications it is required to make.




Halliburton last week said it took some of its systems offline following the detection of the cyberattack. The company now says it is “working to identify effects of the incident” on its ongoing oil and fracking operations.
When contacted on Tuesday, Halliburton spokesperson Amina Rivera did not comment or say if the company knows what kinds of data were stolen. “We are not commenting beyond what was included in our filing,” said Riv…</span>

                              <span>Is Elon’s rumble in the Amazonian jungle on course for a technical knockout? Over the weekend, the Brazilian high court voted to uphold a ban on X that another judge issued the week before for failing to comply with take-down requests. The court will issue fines of up to $9,000 to those who use VPNs to get around that ban. But the debate and drama have not ended there. Mike Masnick over at TechDirt weighs up how the case highlights the complexities of supporting free speech and complying with so-called “hostage laws,” but also how Musk himself, owner of “ExTwitter,” has played different sides depending on what suits him best. Meanwhile, Musk says his satellite communications company Starlink and his other companies have had their assets frozen, as well.</span>

From a scientific perspective, ridding those industries of fossil fuels is possible; economically, it’s not. Or at least not yet, claims a young startup. Oxylus Energy thinks it has the key to one part of the equation.  




The company was spun out of a Yale chemistry lab last year, and it has been working to refine the production of so-called green methanol. Today, most methanol is derived from fossil fuels and used to make petrochemicals, though it can also be used as a transportation fuel. Because of that flexibility, green methanol, which is made without fossil fuels, could rid carbon pollution from a range of industries.

He is replacing Philippe Laffont, the founder of the New York-based investment firm Coatue Management, on ByteDance’s board, per the report. Coatue has been considering selling a portion of its stake in ByteDance, according to a report by The Information on August 23. 
Niel is the owner of French telecom company Iliad. He has also been an active startup investor with his seed investment firm Kima Ventures and through other investment vehicles. Additionally, he created Station F, a startup campus based in Paris, as well as setting up a computer science school called 42.</span>

The Netherlands’ data protection authority, Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (AP), said on Tuesday that it has imposed a penalty of €30.5 million — around $33.7M at current exchange rates — on Clearview AI for a raft of breaches of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) after confirming the database contains images of Dutch citizens.




This fine is larger than separate GDPR sanctions imposed by data protection authorities in France, Italy, Greece and the U.K. back in 2022.

                              <span>X, the social network owned by Elon Musk, is finally rolling out one of the most sought-after features for direct messages: the ability to edit the message.
Over the weekend, X made the edit message feature available to iOS users. One of the engineers at the company posted about the roll-out and said the edit messages function will be available on more platforms soon.


save yourself from your own bad decisions (or typos) (or both)
DM edits are here. you’re welcome https://t.co/RzELFRZgfY
— X (@X) August 31, 2024


Here is how you can use it:
Open any direct message chat from your X iOS app.
Long press on any message that you sent or tap on the three-dot menu beside the message.
Select the “Edit message” option to modify the sent message.
According to a support page, there is no time limit for editing the messages. In our testing, we found out that you can also edit older DMs on the platform too. However, you can only make five edits overall to a message. The social network applies the same limit on editing posts as well.




While X said that it keeps a log of edited messages for security reasons, it doesn’t show the version history of edited messages at the moment. 
Users expect to be able to edit their messages in messaging apps, as other chat apps, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Messenger have had this functionality for a while now. Apple also added the ability to edit messages sent via iMessage with iOS 16.</span>

                              <span>In June 2021, Ziina, fresh from completing YC’s first cohort that year and securing a $7.5 million seed, launched its fintech app to 20,000 retail customers, allowing them to send and receive money. 
Three years later, the Dubai-based startup, which now counts 50,000 retail and business customers after expanding its offerings to meet the needs of micro, small, and medium-sized businesses in the UAE, has netted $22 million in Series A funding led by Altos Ventures.




Indeed, such sizable follow-on funding despite the global funding slowdown underscores investors’ confidence in the fintech company’s growth — the company claims 34% month-over-month growth in customers for the last year, and says its revenues have increased ten-fold over the same period.

The Paris-based company originally offered a way to rent hardware, so instead of spending a small fortune to acquire a bunch of laptops for their employees, companies could use Fleet to lease devices and pay a monthly fee. The company is now launching several software services on top of its hardware-as-a-service proposition, from device management to cybersecurity and insurance.




As a bootstrapped company, Fleet focused on optimizing its operations to remain as lean as possible and spend less money than it earns. For instance, the…</span>

Cercli, the startup they launched in January, addresses this challenge via software it developed that allows businesses in the MENA region to hire, manage and pay their global workforce. The potential of Cercli’s platform has attracted investor interest, leading to $4 million in seed funding led by San Francisco-based Afore Capital, marking the fund’s first deal in the region.

A startup called Doccla is bringing technology to bear address the issue: it’s building “virtual bed” tech to help doctors remotely manage patients who have either been discharged early, or in some cases never go to the hospital at all. After gaining traction in the U.K. and Ireland, it’s now raised £35 million ($46 million) to expand in Europe.  
Lakestar is leading the Series B round; Elaia and several existing investors are also participating. The funding comes two years after Doccla raised a $17 million Series A.

BigEndian Semiconductors aims to capitalize on this shift by kicking off development of surveillance chips for cameras.

                              <span>SparkLabs — an early-stage venture capital firm that has made a name for itself for backing OpenAI as well as a host of other AI startups such as Vectara, Allganize, Kneron, Anthropic, xAI, Glade (YC S23) and Lucidya AI — is gearing up to double down more startups in the space. The VC firm announced Tuesday that it has closed a new $50 million fund, AIM AI Fund, which will back AI startups out of its own AIM-X accelerator in Saudi Arabia as well as other AI startups across the globe.
SparkLabs’ new fund and its wider investment aims underscore the bigger trends that have swirled around artificial intelligence for the last few years. The explosion of interest in generative AI in particular has led to a surge of startups in the space, as well as a rush of investors looking for the next Open …</span>

Its principles of transparency and collaboration have fueled innovation, but balancing these ideals with the practical demands of leading a profitable business operation is no easy feat.  
Industry leaders Casey Aylward, partner at Accel; Scott Johnston, CEO of Docker; and Rowan Trollope, CEO of Reddis will be on the SaaS Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 to explore the complexities of operating using an open source business model and share their views on upcoming shifts in the landscape.

When he was head of product at Zynga, he experienced the height of mobile games, working on hits like Words with Friends; then as a vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, he helped produce tentpole hits like Diablo Immortal. And then, as a director of product management at Meta, he learned to see games in new dimensions while working on the VR game, Horizon Worlds. 
“I had to forget what I thought were universal truths and learn a whole new set of ways to do things,” Lu told TechCrunch.




Now Lu wants a front row seat to where video games are heading. After joining the firm as an investor in 2022, Lu helped launch the firm’s Speedrun accelerator, which invests $750,000 ap…</span>

                              <span>A controversial California bill to prevent AI disasters, SB 1047, has passed final votes in the state’s Senate and now proceeds to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk. He must weigh the most extreme theoretical risks of AI systems — including their potential role in human deaths — against potentially thwarting California’s AI boom. He has until September 30 to sign SB 1047 into law, or veto it altogether.
Introduced by state senator Scott Wiener, SB 1047 aims to prevent the possibility of very large AI models creating catastrophic events, such as loss of life or cyberattacks costing more than $500 million in damages.




To be clear, very few AI models exist today that are large enough to be covered by the bill, and AI has never been used for a cyberattack of this scale. But the bill concerns the…</span>

Delta suing the company for as much as $500 million in damages and hiring lawyer David Boies is perhaps the highest-profile example.
Among Boies’ wide range of high-profile clients are Theranos, Harvey Weinstein, victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Al Gore in Bush v. Gore around the results of the 2000 presidential election. He also led the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s.




Even before Delta came forward, shareholders were looking for their pound of flesh, filing a class action lawsuit against CrowdStrike alleging that the company had misled them regarding its software update procedures.

                              <span>Validus, a Singapore-based digital lending platform for small and medium businesses, has secured $50 million in debt financing from HSBC under the ASEAN Growth Fund strategy.
Validus will use the proceeds to support the financial inclusion of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, addressing the challenges they face in accessing financial resources.




With 64.2 million MSMEs contributing 61% of Indonesia’s GDP, according to Indonesia’s Ministry for Economic Affairs, the potential for growth is immense. These MSMEs employ about 119.6 million people, which is 97% of the total workforce in the country. However, only about 17.5 million MSME players are tapping into the online ecosystem and e-commerce.

                              <span>The Mac mini will be the next Apple device to say goodbye to USB-A, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.
Apple customers have probably gotten used to seeing the familiar, rectangular USB-A ports replaced with their thinner USB-C siblings. And while USB-C has its advantages, the transition can sometimes leave users confused and scrambling for adapters.
The Mac mini, meanwhile, hasn’t been significantly redesigned since 2010, but Gurman says that’s changing this fall. The updated models will include Apple’s new M4 chip, as well as five USB-C ports, plus an Ethernet port, an HDMI connector, and a headphone jack. But the USB-A ports will be gone.
Apple has a “Glowtime” press event scheduled for September 9, where the company is expected to announce the new iPhone 16. The new Mac lineup may not be announced until later in the fall.</span>

                              <span>No matter who powerful generative AI becomes, writer Ted Chiang says it will never create true art.
Chiang is one of the most admired science fiction authors writing today, best known for the novella “Story Of Your Life” (which was adapted into the movie “Arrival”). But he’s also published terrific pieces for The New Yorker looking at the dangers and shortcomings of AI.




You should really read his latest article in its entirety, but briefly: Chiang argues that the potential of large language models remains “largely theoretical” — thus far, generative AI has been most successful at “lowering our expectations, both of the things we read and of ourselves when we write anything for others to read. It is a fundamentally dehumanizing technology because it treats us as less than what we are: creators and apprehenders of meaning.”
Even as LLMs improve, Chiang argues that their output will never be art — which he acknowledges is “notoriously hard to define,” but he tries anyway: “Art is something that results from making a lot of choices.” Sure, those choices might not result in a particularly good novel or painting or film, but you’re still “engaged in an act of communication between you and your audience.”
“We are all products of what has come before us, but it’s by living our lives in interaction with others that we bring meaning into the world,” Chiang concludes. “That is something that an auto-complete algorithm can never do, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”</span>

The significance was more ideological than financial. Any business Palantir gets from startups is dwarfed by its government contracts, after all. But you can’t put a price on philosophical bedfellows. 




Palantir likes to remind the world that it’s not like other publicly traded companies; i.e. buttoned-up and appropriately distanced from its cowboy private days. Sankar ends …</span>

The reasoning goes something like this: If businesses deploy AI assistants to execs and employees, make AI chatbots be front-line salespeople and customer service reps, how can an AI perform well if it doesn’t understand the difference between an angry “What do you mean by that?” and a confused “What do you mean by that?”

Sixty-two years after her debut, Rosey remains an important pop cultural touchstone for the unfulfilled promise of home robots.
The home of 2024 isn’t necessarily wholly devoid of robots. According to its own figures, iRobot has sold more than 50 million Roombas. That, meanwhile, is a fraction of the overall number of robot vacuums that have been sold around the globe. Robot lawnmowers and pool cleaners have gained traction as well, though those figures pale in comparison to their vacuuming counterparts.

                              <span>Startups globally have faced challenges over the last couple of years when trying to exit, due to factors like a frozen IPO market and reduced attractiveness to buyers. In addition, large mergers-and-acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly involving Big Tech or multi-billion-dollar conglomerates.
Notably, a decline in venture investment within any startup ecosystem can often be linked to a lack of exit volume and value. In Africa, for instance, the number of M&amp;A exits peaked at 44 in 2021, when the continent attracted nearly $6 billion in venture capital. However, in 2022, the number of exits dropped to 29, alongside a decrease in venture capital investment to over $3 billion.

“We believe there was some internal miscommunication at Silverbear Capital, one of our lead investors, which has caused unnecessary confusion,” CEO Justin Grooms wrote in an email reportedly viewed by Forbes. “The fact is, they signed a binding term sheet committing $200 million. Our exceptional legal team at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher stands ready to represent the company in seeking to enforce our rights vigorously.”

                              <span>A Brazilian court’s decision to ban X (formerly Twitter) seems to be benefiting its rivals, especially Bluesky.
The microblogging platform announced late Friday that it was seeing “all-time-highs for activity” with 500,000 new users joining in the previous two days. It’s also number one on the free iPhone app chart in Brazil today, ranking just ahead of Meta’s Threads at number two.




Noting the rankings, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber wrote, “good job Brazil, you made the right choice.”
That growth is particularly impressive for a platform that only fully opened to the public in February and winkingly acknowledged its small size (especially compared to rivals X and Threads) by describing itself as “the short king of social apps.” The company says it had more than 6 million users as of May 2024.
Bluesky was first announced in 2019 as a Twitter-backed initiative to build an open, decentralized social protocol. It has since become an independent public benefit corporation, with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey leaving the board earlier this year.
Elon Musk’s X, meanwhile, has been engaged in an escalating legal fight with Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over the company’s refusal to block certain accounts as part of a broader crackdown on what Moraes said is election disinformation. 
X said earlier this month that it would shut down operations in Brazil, with Moraes then warning the company that it would be banned if it did not name a legal representative in the country. He followed through on Friday, and also threatened fines against users who try to circumvent the ban by using a VPN.
As the ban approached, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva seemingly bid farewell to his X followers by linking to his other social media accounts — starting with Bluesky.</span>

                              <span>OpenAI could reportedly increase its valuation to $100 billion. Nvidia and Apple are apparently in talks to contribute to the company’s next fundraising round, and Thrive Capital would lead the deal should it happen, according to The New York Times. OpenAI’s annualized revenue reportedly eclipsed $3.4 billion early this year, but it’s said to be on track to lose $5 billion by year end as it expands its AI training and staffing efforts.
X is marking some links to NPR’s website as “unsafe.” When users click through to read the latest story about an altercation between a Trump campaign staffer and an Arlington National Cemetery employee, they are met with a warning typically applied to malicious links. It’s unclear why NPR’s site would have triggered this warning, though it raises questions a…</span>

                              <span>Amazon announced Friday evening that it has hired Covariant’s founders — Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan — along with “about a quarter” of the startup’s employees. It’s also signed a non-exclusive license to use Covariant’s robotic foundation models.
Earlier this year, Chen told TechCrunch that Covariant is building “a large language model, but for robot language.” In other words, it’s creating AI models for robots, with an initial focus on robotic arms performing common warehouse tasks like bin picking.




“With some of the smartest minds, we will advance fundamental research, marrying our rich expertise to unlock new ways for AI and robots to assist our operations employees,” said Joseph Quinlivan, Vice President of Amazon Fulfillment Technologies &amp; Robotics, in a statement. “[Embedding] Covariant’s AI technology into our existing robot fleet will make them more performant and create real world value for our customers.”
The deal sounds similar to Amazon’s hiring of the founders of AI startup Adept back in June — another deal that gave Amazon access to new talent and technology without having to fully acquire an existing startup.
At the time, The Verge described this approach as a “reverse acquihire,” where tech giants facing antitrust scrutiny can use hiring and licensing deals to disguise their acquisitions, rather than the other way around. 
Covariant, meanwhile, said it will continue operating under the leadership of Ted Stinson and Tianhao Zhang, with Stinson — who’d been the startup’s COO — now stepping into the CEO role. The company added that it remains “dedicated to delivering the Covariant Brain into production environments across a broad set of global industries, including apparel, health and beauty, grocery, and pharmaceuticals.”</span>

He announced that the organization’s prestigious Grammy Awards would finally accept music made with artificial intelligence. At first, people were confused, and then Mason came out to clarify that he meant only humans can submit to the awards, but that AI can be used in the creative process. 




“It’s a bit of a fine line, but that’s going to evolve,” he told TechCrunch about how the Academy is assessing the use of artificial intelligence in music. “My hope is that we can continue to celebrate human creativity at the highest level.” 
The rise of AI has consumed the arts, just as it has Silicon Valley. Everyone is pondering: Will AI replace me? And within music — what happens to copyright? Royalties? To the ha…</span>

                              <span>While searching for mini PCs for my home server, I figured I&#x27;d use the eBay API to find the cheapest ones. Inspired by diskprices.com, I built a static site using Eleventy and a python script that uses regex to parse the data. I tried to include as many filters as possible like OS, Wifi, HDMI etc.
I would like to add power usage, noise levels, PCIe slots but that data is hard to find.
Please let me know if you have any feedback / suggestions.
Thanks!

                              <span>Two decades ago, I posted that I found that the strangler fig plant was an interesting metaphor for the gradual replacement of a legacy system. I didn’t refer to the metaphor since, but meanwhile it grew a life of its own. Other people increasingly referred to the strangler fig approach to modernization, and traffic to that post steadily increased: currently it gets about 5000 page views a month, one of the more popular pages on this site. So I decided I needed to update that page, and have rewritten it, focusing on the core activities we need to do to make a success of such a venture.
